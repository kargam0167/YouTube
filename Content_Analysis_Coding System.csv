1,A digital nomad is anyone who can earn money from a digital medium also making,0:05,A,2,C,1
1,it really easy for them to move around and take their work with them anywhere,0:08,A,2,C,1
1,they go. Which also really suits their location independent or nomadic,0:12,A,2,C,1
1,lifestyle. Now.. conversely a digital nomad is NOT somebody who would ever risk,0:18,A,2,C,1
1,"their livelihood-making-machine also known as ""their laptop"" to sun and sand",0:23,A,2,C,1
1,and salt water and all of the things by just taking crazy photos on the beach and,0:28,A,2,C,1
1,"other locations. Actually, I'm really really guilty of having done this when I",0:32,A,2,C,1
1,first started working online... soo scratch that. But the point is this is actually,0:37,A,2,C,1
1,the first time in history where it's more achievable than ever before for you,0:41,B,1,,
1,to actually make a really great in profitable career from your laptop while,0:45,B,1,,
1,traveling the world. So if you're someone who's been dreaming of quitting their,0:49,B,1,,
1,nine-to-five job in pursuing a laptop lifestyle (because let's face it life is,0:54,B,1,,
1,just way too short for artificially lit grey office cubicles) then this video is,0:59,B,1,,
1,for you! So I'm gonna cover the 7 steps to building your profitable Digital,1:05,D,1,,
1,Nomad Career this year... and it's all based on everything I've learned since,1:10,D,1,,
1,2016 when I first started working online. Based on things I've learned and also,1:15,D,1,,
1,just really based on things that I wish somebody had told me when I first,1:18,D,1,,
1,started. So you will find all of the links to the resources mentioned here in,1:23,D,1,,
1,the description below along with a link to a more in-depth,1:27,D,1,,
1,resource that's gonna provide you with some tips on things like what are the,1:31,D,1,,
1,"actual most profitable freelance careers of this year, where can you learn them,",1:36,D,1,,
1,and how can you actually start earning money from them. So make sure to check,1:39,D,1,,
1,"that out in the description below. And of course, if you like this video and you",1:43,F,3,,
1,want to learn more about how to build and grow your business online make sure,1:47,F,3,,
1,to subscribe to the channel and hit that bell so you get a notification every,1:51,F,3,,
1,time a new video goes live. Step 1 is just to decide on which of the,1:55,D,2,,
1,skills or passions you already possess that you can bring into an online career.,1:59,D,2,,
1,Now you might be surprised to know that a lot of your existing skills can really,2:04,D,2,,
1,easily be translated into an online career but,2:07,D,2,,
1,that's not really the point. The point isn't just to have an online career and,2:11,C,2,,
1,be able to make money online. It's to create a profitable and sustainable,2:15,C,2,,
1,online career that's going to allow you to have the freedom you want in your,2:19,C,2,,
1,life. There's gonna be lots of different YouTube videos and tutorials and blog,2:24,C,2,,
1,posts all about how you can make money with no skills at all. So of course you,2:29,,,,
1,can get paid for things like reviewing Amazon books and even hotels and,2:33,,,,
1,restaurants and taking surveys. But that is not what's going to create this kind,2:37,,,,
1,of sustainable lifestyle for you when it comes to earning money online and,2:42,,,,
1,growing your business. Trust me when I say that the more you put into it the,2:46,F,3,,
1,more you'll get out of it. Make sure to check out my video that's all about how,2:51,F,3,,
1,to find that sweet spot where your passions and your purpose and your,2:54,F,3,,
1,skills all overlap and how to build this into your digital nomad skill set and,2:59,D,2,,
1,where to kind of focus your efforts. But the truth is the most in-demand and the,3:04,D,2,,
1,highest paid skills online are going to take the longest to learn. Which is,3:08,D,2,,
1,natural with absolutely anything out there that's worth doing so the key is,3:12,F,3,C,3
1,just to start little by little. When I first started working online I started,3:17,F,3,C,3
1,posting on Instagram for my clients for $20 an hour just creating really simple,3:21,F,3,C,3
1,graphics and managing their social accounts. And then over the years I,3:25,F,3,C,3
1,started building onto that skill set to also be able to design websites and,3:29,F,3,C,3
1,build out really complex marketing funnels that's allowing me to charge a,3:33,F,3,C,3
1,lot more than $20 an hour. But the key is just to start and then also reinvest,3:39,F,3,C,3
1,into your learning as you go. So Step 2 then is gonna be to actually build out,3:43,D,2,,
1,your skills. Now you can actually do this using free resources out there like,3:47,D,2,,
1,YouTube videos pretty much these days and some blog posts. But I don't recommend,3:51,D,2,,
1,it cause when you're first starting out you need someone who's an expert in that,3:54,D,2,,
1,field to help structure the content for you so you're not overwhelming yourself,3:59,D,2,,
1,by jumping into the more complex stuff first. When you're looking for online,4:03,D,2,,
1,courses you can go to websites like LinkedIn Learning which used to be,4:07,D,2,,
1,Lynda.com that are taught by more professional instructors that are,4:10,D,2,,
1,certified in their field of expertise... or you can go to online marketplaces like,4:15,D,2,,
1,Udemy or Skillshare which are taught by regular people just like me,4:19,D,2,,
1,which are a little bit more digestible and I find them to be a little bit more,4:22,D,2,,
1,human and engaging. But make sure to check out what their reviews are like,4:26,D,2,,
1,and what other students are saying before jumping into a course now on,4:31,D,2,,
1,udemy you can get a course anywhere from about 10 to 20 dollars when they're all,4:34,D,2,,
1,on sale and on Skillshare at the time of recording it's about twenty dollars for,4:38,D,2,,
1,a monthly subscription that gives you access to all of their amazing courses.,4:43,D,2,,
1,So I really recommend these two methods and then also supplementing that with,4:47,,,,
1,"free online learning like using YouTube for that. You can, of course, also take",4:53,,,,
1,"some more expensive, more advanced courses that are about five hundred to",4:56,,,,
1,five thousand dollars... but when you're first starting out my biggest piece of,5:01,,,,
1,advice is to not overwhelm yourself by investing way too much into this journey,5:06,,,,
1,before you really know if you're enjoying it before you even know if it's,5:09,,,,
1,something that you really want. So start with the more kind of budget conscious,5:14,,,,
1,choices and then continue reinvesting into your learning. Now for those of you,5:19,,,,
1,"out there who are gonna say ""oh don't I actually need a formal degree to work in",5:23,R,2,,
1,"this field?"" whatever your chosen field is, I'm gonna tell you right now that I",5:28,R,2,,
1,don't have a formal qualification in digital marketing. I taught myself,5:31,R,2,,
1,everything I know and I have worked with everyone from solopreneurs to,5:36,R,2,,
1,multi-million dollar enterprises and digital marketing agencies and just,5:40,R,2,,
1,about everyone in between and not once has anybody asked me for a formal,5:44,R,2,,
1,qualification proof. Because I know what I'm doing and that's so much more,5:48,R,2,,
1,important in the online world than a piece of paper. And also a three or four,5:54,R,2,,
1,year Bachelor's Degree or any other kind of degree is gonna be so outdated by the,5:59,R,2,,
1,time you would graduate that there's really no point. Because the digital,6:02,R,2,,
1,world is just moving far too quickly. Alright so now I'm moving on to Step 3 -,6:06,R,2,,
1,which is to build out your portfolio. Now once again this does not have to be this,6:11,D,3,,
1,complex custom coded expensive WordPress site like a lot of people would suggest,6:16,D,3,,
1,that you need. You can easily do this by just pimping out your LinkedIn profile,6:20,D,3,,
1,or if you're maybe working full time still and you don't want your boss,6:25,D,3,,
1,getting suspicious about your sudden career change on your LinkedIn profile..,6:29,D,3,,
1,then just go ahead and build a one-page portfolio sign with a free,6:34,D,3,,
1,tool like Strikingly. If you'd like to learn how to do that make sure to check,6:37,D,3,,
1,out my video on how to build your one page portfolio site in less than 30,6:41,D,3,,
1,minutes. Again when I first started I had no way to do this either and I was,6:45,F,3,D,2
1,actually still working full-time so I couldn't do anything with my LinkedIn,6:49,F,3,D,2
1,"profile all I did is put together some graphics on Canva, I put together a few",6:54,F,3,D,2
1,marketing videos and I also did a few articles on Medium.com which is a free,6:59,F,3,D,2
1,site where I could showcase my copywriting style and then I linked,7:03,F,3,D,2
1,everything to my one page portfolio site that I could then send when I was,7:07,F,3,D,2
1,reaching out to clients on LinkedIn or through Facebook groups. So it can be,7:11,F,3,D,2
1,"something really simple like that, it doesn't have to be really complicated",7:14,,,,
1,and I promise you it's a lot more than a lot of other freelancers out there doing.,7:18,,,,
1,So Step 4 then is to decide on your business model. Now... the digital nomad,7:23,A,2,,
1,work pool kind of divides itself into these three categories: one is working,7:28,A,2,,
1,"remotely, the second one is freelancing on a contract basis, and the last one is",7:32,A,2,,
1,running your own online business. So let's talk about some pros and cons of,7:36,A,2,,
1,each of these to decide which one might be right for you.,7:39,,,,
1,Alright so now starting with working remotely. An example might be if you were,7:43,D,2,,
1,a full-time social media manager for an e-commerce brand - this can mean taking,7:48,D,2,,
1,your existing job that you already have remote by negotiating with your boss or,7:53,D,2,,
1,maybe applying for a full-time permanent remote role on sites like RemoteOK or,7:58,D,2,,
1,We Work Remotely. Pros of this is that you can work full time get benefits even,8:03,D,2,,
1,a holiday and sick pay just working from your laptop and you have a consistent,8:08,A,3,,
1,rate of pay month-to-month. Cons are that you are likely restricted to the,8:12,A,3,,
1,timezone of your employer so you can't just pick up and move halfway across the,8:16,A,3,,
1,world because you might be stuck working from 9:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m. instead and,8:21,A,3,,
1,driving yourself a little bit nuts. When it comes to freelancing - examples of this,8:26,C,2,A,2
1,"would be a copywriter for a health food brand, a video editor for a yoga youtube",8:31,C,2,A,2
1,"channel, or a graphic designer for an accounting firm. These types of jobs you",8:36,C,2,A,2
1,can get through networking either in person or online,8:39,C,2,A,2
1,in Facebook groups or LinkedIn outreach or dedicated platforms,8:43,C,2,A,2
1,like Freelancer and Upwork. The pros of this is that you have flexibility of,8:47,C,2,A,2
1,"clients and flexibility in the type of work you do and your contract length. If,",8:53,C,2,A,2
1,"like me, you really enjoy dynamic work - then this might be the way to go for you..",8:57,C,2,A,2
1,because it will allow you to work on multiple projects with multiple clients,9:01,C,2,A,2
1,and also generally allow you to charge higher rates as you're not on a salary,9:06,C,2,A,2
1,but you're on an hourly weekly or per project payment structure. Now the cons,9:12,C,2,A,2
1,of this is that it can be an organisational nightmare if you're not,9:15,C,2,A,2
1,"naturally organised, and you also have to be really good at setting boundaries",9:20,C,2,A,2
1,with your clients because you might have five or more clients at a time. And your,9:25,C,2,A,2
1,pay might also vary from month to month. So those are some things to consider,9:28,C,2,A,2
1,there. Now the last of these is starting your own online business for things like,9:34,C,2,A,2
1,Dropshipping or Amazon FBA or online course creation or having other digital,9:39,C,2,A,2
1,products like a membership site for example. Now the pros here is that it can,9:43,C,2,A,2
1,be much more passive once you get a little bit of momentum especially when,9:48,,,,
1,it comes to digital products like online courses where you can create your course,9:53,,,,
1,once and then sites like Udemy or Skillshare will actually sell it for you,9:57,,,,
1,and market it for you. Now the cons here are that this is the riskiest of the,10:01,A,2,F,3
1,three strategies and it's very hands-on and time-consuming especially when,10:06,A,2,F,3
1,you're setting everything up. So it does kind of seem that everyone in the online,10:10,A,2,F,3
1,world is always telling you to niche down and narrow down and find your niche. And,10:14,A,2,F,3
1,I would actually disagree with this and go out on a limb here a little bit.,10:18,A,2,F,3
1,Because it wasn't really my approach and it isn't to this day. When I first,10:22,A,2,F,3
1,"started working online, and for quite a while afterwards... I focused on just",10:27,A,2,F,3
1,getting as many experiences in as many fields as I could. So I made an effort to,10:32,A,2,F,3
1,work with clients of all different sizes all different customer bases and in,10:38,A,2,F,3
1,different industries so I could learn what worked for me and what didn't and,10:41,A,2,F,3
1,where my passions really were. So I worked with everyone from baby clothing,10:45,A,2,F,3
1,brands and investors and software developers and,10:48,A,2,F,3
1,energy retailers and everyone in between. So I could figure out what I actually,10:52,A,2,F,3
1,really wanted to focus on in the future. So I would recommend that before even,10:58,A,2,F,3
1,thinking about starting your own online business and your own passive income,11:02,A,2,F,3
1,"which is the goal, and it's exactly what I ended up doing with my online courses",11:06,,,,
1,to supplement my freelancing income - I would try and get as many experiences,11:11,,,,
1,working with a variety of clients before deciding on what's right for you. And now,11:15,,,,
1,over to you guys do you know of other ways that people,11:17,,,,
1,have made money online that you'd like to share with me? Let me know in the,11:21,,,,
1,comments below and something maybe I can focus on in future videos as well. Now,11:25,,,,
1,Moving on to Step 5... before we go into how to decide where to actually set up,11:30,,,,
1,your virtual office in Step 6 I also wanted to cover something that people,11:34,,,,
1,seem to forget about a lot when it comes to this Digital Nomad lifestyle which is,11:38,J,2,,
1,all about knowing your numbers. What I mean by this is just you need to know,11:43,J,2,,
1,what your expenses are every month so you need to know exactly what you need,11:47,J,2,,
1,to earn in order to just break even and then also to earn more on top to,11:52,J,2,,
1,contribute to your savings. So if you know that 2k a month is the bare,11:56,J,2,,
1,"minimum you need to make in order to break even on your expenses, and you're",12:00,J,2,,
1,charging $50 an hour then you know that 40 hours that month is the minimum you,12:04,J,2,,
1,need to work in order to break even. Assuming you're also charging your taxes,12:09,J,2,,
1,in your country on top of your hourly rate. So it really scares me when people,12:14,J,2,,
1,don't really know their revenue and profit numbers. If they say things like,12:19,J,2,,
1,I'm making a hundred grand a month from Facebook Ads!,12:22,,,,
1,"Yeah but if you spent 99 grand on your Facebook Ads then you've made $1,000",12:27,,,,
1,profit and that's not gonna get you very far. So know your numbers and also just,12:33,C,1,J,2
1,be really conscious of being able to put money aside for doing really exciting,12:37,C,1,J,2
1,things in the place that you're in! There's no point in living in beautiful,12:40,C,1,J,2
1,places like Cambodia and Bali if you're not putting a little bit of money aside,12:44,C,1,J,2
1,on doing really exciting things in the place that you're in and exploring,12:49,C,1,J,2
1,"nature, and culture and all those wonderful things that come along with",12:52,C,1,J,2
1,being able to be a digital nomad. So now at Step 6 -,12:55,C,1,J,2
1,let's talk about how to actually choose your,12:58,C,1,J,2
1,ideal travel destination. First and foremost - be VERY aware of time zones. So,13:02,C,2,,
1,at the moment I'm in Australia and if I had an Aussie client and I was gonna go,13:06,C,2,,
1,back home to visit my family in Canada for a couple of months that might mean a,13:11,C,2,,
1,few 3 a.m. Skype calls with my clients. Which might be fine from time to time,13:15,C,2,,
1,but probably not sustainable long term. So be very aware of time zones first and,13:20,J,2,,
1,"foremost and then really think about things like cost of living, internet",13:25,J,2,,
1,"speed, temperature, culture, food... all of the things that really matter to you.",13:29,J,2,,
1,That are individual to where you want to travel to. My favourite resource for this,13:34,J,2,,
1,is Nomadlist - it has a rating for every digital nomad hotspot around the,13:40,J,2,,
1,"world. Including average cost of living per month, temperature, Wi-Fi speed and it",13:46,J,2,,
1,even has a fun and safety rating. And this awesome website even connects other,13:51,L,2,,
1,digital nomads in a helpful community forum and even has a dating section!,13:55,L,2,,
1,which brings me to my next and final point,13:57,L,2,,
1,Step 7 - connect with your people! I cannot say this enough but co-working spaces,14:02,L,2,,
1,might just be the best investment that you make as a digital nomad. Some of my,14:07,L,2,,
1,favourite people I've met from around the world have been through co-working,14:11,L,2,,
1,"spaces especially when I was living in Canggu, Bali. So these kind of",14:16,L,2,,
1,co-working spaces will put a lot of effort into connecting their community,14:20,L,2,,
1,and having skill share sessions so people can pass on their knowledge to others.,14:23,,,,
1,And you might find people who are in your industry and in your niche and in,14:27,,,,
1,"your skill set who are just those few steps ahead, who can help you out. And likewise",14:32,D,2,,
1,you will find people who are a few steps behind where you are which will allow,14:36,D,2,,
1,you to pass on your own knowledge and make you feel really good about how far,14:40,D,2,,
1,you've come. So chances are there is a co-working space near you wherever you,14:44,D,2,,
1,are in the world make sure to check out coworker.com and see if there are any,14:48,D,2,,
1,awesome spaces near you that might even offer a free trial for you to go and,14:53,D,2,,
1,maybe check it out just to get a feel for what your digital nomad life might,14:57,D,2,,
1,look like. Alright so that was a lot of information and as I said at the,15:01,D,2,,
1,beginning the links to the resources mentioned throughout are listed in the,15:05,D,2,,
1,description below along you are linked to that resource I,15:08,D,2,,
1,mentioned that's gonna have a complete list of all the places that you can find,15:13,D,2,,
1,"work online as a digital nomad, a list of the most in-demand and highest-paid",15:18,,,,
1,"freelancing gigs out there this year, and even some discounts to courses that you",15:23,,,,
1,can access that are going to help you to get on the right track in getting your,15:28,S,3,,
1,digital nomad career up and running in just a few months. And I've also included,15:33,S,3,,
1,an extra special bonus of teaching you how to actually save money while you,15:38,S,3,,
1,travel through house-sitting. House-sitting is one of my favourite,15:41,S,3,,
1,digital nomad money-saving-hacks because I've been able to live rent-free,15:45,S,3,,
1,for sometimes up to six months out of the year through house-sitting. Which has,15:50,S,3,,
1,allowed me to save a lot of money while I travel and allowing me to explore new,15:54,S,3,,
1,places which is so so awesome so make sure to check it out by going to the,15:59,S,3,,
1,link in the description or head straight through to livingtoroam.com/digital-nomad,16:03,S,3,,

2,doesn't allow you to live in Estonia,1:10,E,2,,
2,doesn't lead to citizenship someone,1:12,E,2,,
2,asked you know what about Estonian residency,1:14,E,2,,
2,--is ensure we talked about that in a,1:16,E,2,A,2
2,video no such thing you're not going to,1:18,E,2,A,2
2,become a citizen you don't get to live,1:19,E,2,A,2
2,there none of that,1:21,E,2,A,2
2,what a residents was done was to,1:23,E,2,A,2
2,facilitate people digitally being able,1:27,E,2,A,2
2,to access services like taxes and,1:30,E,2,A,2
2,banking and corporate filings in Estonia,1:33,E,2,A,2
2,and it was designed to bring more,1:35,E,2,A,2
2,entrepreneurs in the digital economy,1:37,E,2,A,2
2,into this small Baltic country I don't,1:41,E,2,A,2
2,understand why a lot of folks got it I'm,1:43,E,2,A,2
2,gonna walk you through some of my,1:44,,,,
2,reasons now you know I got it it's it's,1:46,,,,
2,cool it's a trinket it's fun it's my way,1:48,,,,
2,to be part of the cool kids that was,1:50,,,,
2,some of the cool kids for doing a couple,1:51,,,,
2,years ago we got our Stoney at your,1:53,,,,
2,residence now let me say I really,1:55,,,,
2,respect the government of Estonia I,1:57,,,,
2,think they've done a great job I think,1:58,,,,
2,they've been forward-thinking you know,2:00,E,2,A,2
2,we were in talks with the former,2:03,E,2,,
2,president of Estonia who was looking at,2:05,E,2,,
2,who actually brought this program to,2:07,E,2,,
2,fruition about coming to nomad,2:08,E,2,,
2,capitalist line we ultimately now have,2:11,E,2,,
2,mikhail saakashvili the president of,2:12,E,2,,
2,georgia coming but i you know that shows,2:15,E,2,,
2,how i really respect what estonia is,2:16,E,2,,
2,done in wanting to be different in,2:18,E,2,,
2,wanting to make things more efficient,2:20,E,2,,
2,and wanting to make things more,2:21,E,2,,
2,accessible,2:22,E,2,,
2,i'm all for them on that here's the,2:25,E,2,,
2,challenge that you've seen in estonia as,2:26,E,2,,
2,well as it several other countries like,2:28,E,2,,
2,Hong Kong the government's goal of,2:30,E,2,,
2,opening things up and opening the,2:32,E,2,,
2,country up to new entrepreneurs is not,2:34,E,2,,
2,necessarily matched by that of the banks,2:37,E,2,,
2,okay and so what's happened is this year,2:40,S,1,A,2
2,which was supposed to allow you to,2:42,S,1,A,2
2,basically open an Estonian company and,2:44,S,1,A,2
2,open your bank account in Estonia and do,2:47,S,1,A,2
2,all your business and file everything,2:48,S,1,A,2
2,without,2:48,S,1,A,2
2,being there there's a whole ecosystem of,2:50,S,1,A,2
2,companies some of which I know the,2:52,S,1,A,2
2,people and they're very nice but this,2:54,,,,
2,whole ecosystem opened up to support on,2:55,,,,
2,that premise where rather than going,2:58,S,1,C,2
2,offshore the traditional offshore,3:00,S,1,C,2
2,companies people they said oh it's,3:01,S,1,C,2
2,expensive and it's confusing and in a,3:03,S,1,C,2
2,deed you know it can be they said oh,3:06,S,1,C,2
2,it's so easy in Estonia just pay this,3:07,S,1,C,2
2,one monthly fee and is this kind of very,3:09,S,1,C,2
2,millennial ish kind of kind of way to,3:11,S,1,C,2
2,start your company but then what,3:13,S,1,C,2
2,happened was the banks started really,3:15,S,1,C,2
2,turning their nose up a lot of folks and,3:16,,,,
2,they said well what's your connection to,3:18,,,,
2,Estonia that's I collect a question a,3:20,,,,
2,lot of banks around the world well ask,3:21,E,2,,
2,you when you go to open an account you,3:23,E,2,,
2,know we're constantly researching in,3:24,E,2,,
2,banks and we keep a list of over a,3:26,E,2,,
2,thousands of them and some of those,3:28,E,2,,
2,banks do not require you to have a,3:30,E,2,,
2,connection to their country and we've,3:32,E,2,,
2,talked about that in other videos but in,3:33,E,2,,
2,Estonia being part of the European Union,3:36,E,2,,
2,you know being that they were getting so,3:38,E,2,,
2,much interest from folks the banks were,3:40,E,2,,
2,able to say well hold on a second you,3:41,E,2,,
2,know we don't need all these new,3:42,E,2,,
2,customers let's be more strict no you,3:45,E,2,,
2,know you're a guy living in the United,3:47,E,2,,
2,States or Afghanistan or whatever else,3:49,E,2,,
2,running your business you know why are,3:51,E,2,,
2,you running your business in Estonian it,3:52,E,2,,
2,became very difficult to the point where,3:54,E,2,,
2,a lot of the things you could do with,3:55,E,2,,
2,the e residents just weren't working out,3:57,E,2,,
2,you couldn't open your bank account the,3:59,E,2,,
2,government stuff worked but you know,4:02,E,2,,
2,even some of the corporate service stuff,4:03,E,2,,
2,just wasn't working very well okay and,4:06,E,2,,
2,so I think a lot of people now that I've,4:08,,,,
2,talked to have just kind of gotten away,4:10,E,3,,
2,from it now let's step back one step you,4:12,E,3,,
2,know besides just having this kind of,4:14,E,3,,
2,cool trinket and and respecting what,4:16,E,3,,
2,Estonia is done in trying to to,4:18,E,3,,
2,modernize their economy and they've I,4:19,E,3,,
2,mean if considering their background you,4:23,E,3,,
2,look at how I think was Jorge Bush who was,4:25,E,3,,
2,talking about you know in the United,4:27,E,3,,
2,States we ought to be more like Estonia,4:28,E,3,,
2,we can file your taxes in five minutes,4:30,E,3,,
2,look at where Estonia was 30 years ago,4:32,,,,
2,that to me exactly makes the point of,4:34,,,,
2,what we talk about here at nomad,4:35,,,,
2,capitalist things are changing there are,4:38,E,2,,
2,new safe havens emerging and people,4:40,E,2,,
2,found out about Estonia but the problem,4:42,E,2,,
2,was with the government wanted to do,4:43,E,2,,
2,didn't match what the banks want to do,4:44,E,2,,
2,but let's step back okay people want,4:47,E,2,,
2,that and act like Estonia was this great,4:49,E,2,,
2,amazing tax haven and people are,4:50,E,2,,
2,promoting it is is something that was on,4:52,E,2,,
2,par with an offshore company now an,4:55,E,2,,
2,offshore company could be any company in,4:57,E,2,,
2,a place where you don't live and so if,4:59,E,2,,
2,you live in the United States if you,5:00,E,2,,
2,live in Ireland if you live in,5:02,E,2,,
2,Germany whatever then Estonia,5:03,E,2,,
2,technically is a foreign corporation but,5:07,E,2,,
2,is it the most tax-efficient corporation,5:09,E,2,,
2,I think a lot of people got sucked in,5:11,,,,
2,because of the the cool ecosystem where,5:14,,,,
2,it seemed really easy and yes ease of,5:16,,,,
2,operation is important you know one of,5:18,,,,
2,the people asked you know Andrew why do,5:19,C,2,,
2,you talk to seven or eight figure,5:20,C,2,,
2,entrepreneurs I said because it's a five,5:22,C,2,,
2,figure level a lot of the things that we,5:23,C,2,,
2,do in our business for folks,5:25,C,2,,
2,it just isn't cost-efficient you know if,5:27,C,2,,
2,"you're making $80,000 a year and your",5:29,C,2,,
2,tax bill is you know eighteen thousand,5:31,C,2,,
2,dollars a year a lot of the things that,5:33,C,2,,
2,that worked for a guy making you know,5:36,C,2,,
2,half a million a million two million ten,5:37,C,2,,
2,million dollars a year it's not worth it,5:40,C,2,,
2,you'd rather just pay the eighteen grand,5:42,C,2,,
2,and so in a sense the ease of operations,5:44,C,2,,
2,in Estonia was okay Estonia does have a,5:47,E,3,,
2,twenty percent tax rate however you can,5:49,E,3,,
2,defer that tax until you actually take,5:50,E,3,,
2,the money out that works for certain,5:52,E,3,,
2,people and one time under the entire,5:54,E,3,,
2,history of our business have I,5:55,E,3,,
2,recommended an Estonian company for,5:57,E,3,,
2,someone who actually went and set it up,5:59,E,3,,
2,it served a very specific need involving,6:01,E,3,,
2,tax treaties and an IP and different,6:03,E,3,,
2,stuff very specific need and the guy was,6:06,E,3,,
2,not planning and making huge profits it,6:08,E,3,,
2,was not going to be a big cash cow,6:09,E,3,,
2,business potentially and we had an,6:11,,,,
2,entire thought process for recommending,6:13,,,,
2,Estonia that was back in early 2017 and,6:16,,,,
2,so it's been years since I've ever,6:18,A,3,,
2,recommended Estonia because if you need,6:20,A,3,,
2,a European Union country for some kind,6:22,A,3,,
2,of tax treaties or you're doing some,6:25,A,3,,
2,kind of business in the EU there are,6:26,A,3,,
2,better options for most businesses with,6:28,A,3,,
2,lower rates that also have good,6:31,A,3,,
2,ecosystems that may not be a sexy they,6:33,A,3,,
2,may not be as digitized but you're gonna,6:35,A,3,,
2,pay less and that's probably worth it,6:38,A,3,,
2,most folks I don't think even need a,6:40,A,3,,
2,European Union company but I look at,6:42,A,3,,
2,most the folks that come to us who are,6:44,A,3,,
2,doing business online or who are doing,6:46,A,3,,
2,consulting or doing anything that's,6:48,A,3,,
2,location-independent a lot of those,6:51,A,3,,
2,folks you know very rarely do we need to,6:53,A,3,,
2,have some kind of company in the,6:54,A,3,,
2,European Union and so you know for me,6:57,A,3,,
2,why defer tax when you can just,6:58,A,3,,
2,eliminate entirely or when you can lock,7:01,A,3,,
2,in some kind of low very low tax rate,7:04,A,3,,
2,and just pay it now and be done and so,7:06,A,3,,
2,for most folks again I'm speaking,7:08,A,3,,
2,largely to the six figure 7 and 8-figure,7:11,,,,
2,levels I just haven't found it starting,7:14,E,2,,
2,to be the best place to incorporate and,7:15,E,2,,
2,I think where people got tripped up a,7:18,E,2,,
2,little bit was they saw a residents they,7:21,E,2,,
2,saw this whole kind of sex appeal of,7:23,E,2,,
2,Estonia and then said great how do I get,7:25,E,2,,
2,in and how do I tweak the e residents to,7:27,E,2,,
2,work how do I tweak the banks to suit,7:29,E,2,,
2,what I'm trying to do rather than asking,7:31,,,,
2,we'll hold on you know what's the best,7:33,,,,
2,jurisdiction I understand you know I I,7:36,,,,
2,do business in Asia,7:38,,,,
2,I have companies and banks where if I,7:40,A,2,,
2,want to make a change I just had to,7:42,A,2,,
2,reset my online banking the other day I,7:44,A,2,,
2,had a printed a form sign it send it,7:46,A,2,,
2,back I get that the pain but is it worth,7:49,A,2,,
2,paying tens or hundreds of thousands of,7:51,A,2,,
2,dollars more to avoid having to print,7:54,A,2,,
2,out a one-page form sign it take a,7:56,A,2,,
2,picture of it on your phone and email to,7:57,A,2,,
2,them and I think that's what you have to,7:59,A,2,,
2,ask yourself you know why do you need a,8:01,A,2,,
2,company in Estonia when you have the,8:03,A,2,,
2,whole world open to you the e residence,8:07,A,2,,
2,is cool but it probably shouldn't be,8:09,A,2,,
2,dictating where you're banking on a,8:10,A,2,,
2,personal level on a business level or,8:12,A,2,,
2,where you're setting up your company I,8:14,A,2,,
2,think a lot of folks got into Estonia,8:16,A,2,,
2,without respect to what I call my tax,8:18,A,2,,
2,friendly quadrant they probably weren't,8:21,A,2,,
2,setting up their structures perfectly,8:22,A,2,,
2,they weren't solving their personal tax,8:24,A,2,,
2,issues those are all the questions that,8:26,A,2,,

3,work online,0:39,F,3,,
3,and travel the world if you're new here,0:42,F,3,,
3,i've been a digital nomad or,0:44,F,3,,
3,expat for more than half of my life and,0:46,F,3,,
3,have had a remote company helping other,0:49,F,3,,
3,people do the same,0:50,F,3,,
3,for more than a decade but let's jump,0:53,,,,
3,right into the details of dubai's,0:55,,,,
3,digital nomad visa,0:57,,,,
3,first the united arab emirates is one of,0:59,,,,
3,at least,1:00,,,,
3,eight countries in 2020 that are,1:03,,,,
3,offering,1:03,,,,
3,an official remote work and travel visa,1:06,E,1,A,2
3,catering to digital nomads other,1:09,E,1,A,2
3,countries to do so,1:10,E,1,A,2
3,some of which we have covered on this,1:12,E,1,A,2
3,channel include,1:14,E,1,A,2
3,aruba bermuda barbados croatia,1:18,E,1,A,2
3,estonia georgia and antigua and barbuda,1:22,E,1,A,2
3,so what these countries have in common,1:24,E,1,A,2
3,is that they're all,1:25,E,1,A,2
3,offering a digital nomad visa that will,1:28,E,1,A,2
3,allow foreigners to,1:29,E,1,A,2
3,live and work there with just a passport,1:32,E,1,A,2
3,so you don't have to qualify for,1:34,E,1,A,2
3,permanent residency,1:36,E,1,A,2
3,apply for a work permit or get,1:39,E,1,A,2
3,citizenship,1:40,,,,
3,this is a big deal because getting a,1:42,J,2,B,1
3,work permit,1:43,J,2,B,1
3,permanent residency or citizenship can,1:45,J,2,B,1
3,be a complicated,1:47,J,2,B,1
3,and costly affair with citizenship,1:49,J,2,B,1
3,costing up to hundreds of thousands,1:51,J,2,B,1
3,and in some cases millions of dollars,1:54,J,2,B,1
3,depending on the country you're applying,1:55,J,2,B,1
3,in,1:56,J,2,B,1
3,you can learn more about these other,1:57,J,2,B,1
3,countries and the links in this video's,1:59,J,2,B,1
3,description,2:00,J,2,B,1
3,but specifically to apply for dubai's,2:03,J,2,B,1
3,digital nomad visa program,2:05,J,2,B,1
3,you will need first to pay the,2:07,J,2,B,1
3,non-refundable,2:08,J,2,B,1
3,application fee of 287,2:11,J,2,B,1
3,passport,2:14,J,2,B,1
3,u.s dollars you will also need a,2:14,J,2,B,1
3,with a minimum of six months validity,2:17,J,2,B,1
3,until it expires,2:18,J,2,B,1
3,and you'll also need health insurance,2:21,J,2,B,1
3,with uae,2:22,J,2,B,1
3,coverage most importantly you will need,2:25,J,2,B,1
3,proof,2:26,J,2,B,1
3,of either having a remote job or being a,2:29,J,2,B,1
3,self-employed online business owner,2:32,J,2,B,1
3,and in either case you will need to,2:34,J,2,B,1
3,prove a minimum,2:35,J,2,B,1
3,monthly income of 5 000 us dollars,2:39,J,2,B,1
3,and you can prove this with something,2:40,J,2,B,1
3,like your bank statements,2:42,J,2,B,1
3,paycheck stubs or financial statements,2:45,J,2,B,1
3,approval,2:46,J,2,B,1
3,is not guaranteed but i think for a less,2:49,J,2,B,1
3,than 300,2:50,J,2,B,1
3,application fee and the possibility of,2:53,J,2,B,1
3,staying in dubai for up to a year,2:55,J,2,B,1
3,it's definitely worth it,2:58,J,2,B,1
3,[Music],2:59,,,,
3,announced,3:02,E,1,A,1
3,prior to this digital nomad visa being,3:02,E,1,A,1
3,the citizens of many countries could,3:04,E,1,A,1
3,still travel to the uae,3:07,E,1,A,1
3,but in most cases it was with a passport,3:10,E,1,A,1
3,and a visa on arrival for up to 30 days,3:13,E,1,A,1
3,so being able to live and work in dubai,3:15,E,1,A,1
3,for up to 12 months,3:17,E,1,A,1
3,is a really great opportunity you'll,3:19,E,1,A,1
3,also get access to local services,3:22,E,1,A,1
3,like telecommunications utilities and,3:24,E,1,A,1
3,even,3:25,E,1,A,1
3,schooling options authorities in dubai,3:27,E,1,A,1
3,have also specified,3:29,,,,
3,get,3:32,,,,
3,that by applying for this visa you would,3:32,Q,1,A,2
3,access to dubai's very diverse and,3:35,Q,1,A,2
3,skilled workforce,3:36,Q,1,A,2
3,of more than 200 nationalities and,3:39,Q,1,A,2
3,that's really,3:40,Q,1,A,2
3,important to point out because it's,3:41,Q,1,A,2
3,quite different from other countries,3:43,Q,1,A,2
3,offering digital nomad visas most,3:46,Q,1,A,2
3,countries have been,3:47,Q,1,A,2
3,really specific that although you can,3:49,Q,1,A,2
3,live,3:50,Q,1,A,2
3,in their country and work from your,3:52,Q,1,A,2
3,laptop you can't work with other people,3:54,Q,1,A,2
3,locally,3:55,Q,1,A,2
3,in the country so it appears that dubai,3:57,Q,1,A,2
3,is taking things a step,3:59,Q,1,A,2
3,further and possibly allowing digital,4:01,Q,1,A,2
3,nomads to,4:02,Q,1,A,2
3,interact with and work with the local,4:12,Q,1,A,2
3,workforce,4:14,Q,1,A,2
3,although i've been to 60 countries i,4:16,Q,1,A,2
3,haven't had the opportunity to travel to,4:18,Q,1,A,2
3,dubai,4:19,Q,1,A,2
3,just yet that being said it's become,4:21,Q,1,A,2
3,somewhat of a haven,4:23,Q,1,A,2
3,for expats due to its strong economy,4:26,Q,1,A,2
3,high quality of life and many job,4:28,Q,1,A,2
3,opportunities,4:29,Q,1,A,2
3,as i mentioned citizens of more than 200,4:32,T,2,A,1
3,nationalities,4:34,T,2,A,1
3,live in dubai and westerners,4:36,T,2,A,1
3,specifically,4:37,T,2,A,1
3,make up more than five percent of the,4:39,T,2,A,1
3,population,4:40,T,2,A,1
3,or almost half a million people nasif,4:43,T,2,A,1
3,kayed,4:44,T,2,A,1
3,the ceo and founder of the arab,4:46,T,2,A,1
3,culturalist consultancy,4:48,T,2,A,1
3,based in dubai has said that the,4:50,T,2,A,1
3,country's strength,4:52,T,2,A,1
3,is in its diversity he says dubai has,4:55,T,2,A,1
3,always been a very cosmopolitan,4:57,T,2,A,1
3,society that has enjoyed its differences,5:00,T,2,A,1
3,including different religious and ethnic,5:02,T,2,A,1
3,backgrounds,5:04,T,2,A,1
3,one thing that digital nomads are always,5:06,G,2,,
3,looking for is,5:07,G,2,,
3,safety and security,5:10,G,2,,
3,[Music],5:11,G,2,,
3,and the emirates does offer that the,5:14,G,2,,
3,country ranks 41st out of 163,5:17,G,2,,
3,countries on the global peace index and,5:20,G,2,,
3,it ranks third,5:21,G,2,,
3,just behind qatar and kuwait in the,5:23,G,2,,
3,middle east,5:24,G,2,,
3,dubai however as a city has one of the,5:27,G,2,,
3,world's,5:28,G,2,,
3,lowest crime rates it ranks in sixth,5:31,G,2,,
3,place,5:31,G,2,,
3,worldwide just behind zurich switzerland,5:34,G,2,,
3,since the coronavirus pandemic tourism,5:37,G,2,,
3,in dubai,5:38,G,2,,
3,has reopened however as the emirates has,5:41,G,2,,
3,reopened its borders to citizens of all,5:43,G,2,,
3,nationalities,5:44,G,2,,
3,which you can learn more about in this,5:46,G,2,,
3,video over here but that means,5:48,,,,
3,that luxury hotels restaurants,5:51,,,,
3,shopping malls as well as theme parks,5:54,,,,
3,beaches and,5:55,,,,
3,other attractions are all open dubai has,5:58,,,,
3,also been awarded,5:59,,,,
3,the safe travel stamp by the world,6:01,,,,
3,travel and tourism council,6:03,,,,
3,but dubai has also created their own,6:06,,,,
3,local safety ranking,6:07,,,,
3,with the dubai assured stamp which,6:10,,,,
3,certifies which establishments have,6:12,,,,
3,implemented,6:13,,,,
3,appropriate health and safety protocols,6:16,A,2,,
3,the team working on the digital nomad,6:18,A,2,,
3,visa in dubai has said that they're,6:20,A,2,,
3,trying to position the city,6:21,A,2,,
3,as a safe place to live and work but,6:24,A,2,,
3,that also has,6:25,A,2,,
3,a positive work-life balance and i think,6:28,A,2,,
3,that's something that,6:29,A,2,,
3,all of us are looking for dubai has also,6:32,A,2,,
3,long been regarded as a business hub in,6:35,A,2,,
3,asia,6:36,A,2,,
3,with plenty of co-working and office,6:38,A,2,,
3,facilities,6:39,A,2,,
3,and if you want to learn more about,6:41,A,2,,
3,luxury co-living,6:43,,,,
3,and co-working in dubai check out my,6:45,,,,
3,other video here,6:46,,,,
3,overall what's important for digital,6:48,,,,
3,nomads to know,6:50,,,,
3,is that dubai consistently ranks very,6:52,,,,
3,high,6:53,,,,
3,when it comes to safety and security and,6:56,,,,
3,quality of life as well as business and,6:59,,,,
3,infrastructure,7:00,,,,
3,the website teleport says it's,7:01,,,,
3,especially good,7:03,,,,
3,be a,7:06,,,,
3,for startups and businesses and it could,7:06,,,,
3,largely overlooked and underrated,7:09,,,,
3,digital nomad destination,7:11,,,,
3,given it an,7:14,,,,
3,my friends over at nomad capitalist have,7:14,,,,
3,8.8 out of 10 for quality of life,7:18,,,,
3,and they describe life in dubai as quote,7:21,,,,
3,very high tech,7:22,,,,
3,futuristic even and definitely luxurious,7:26,J,1,,
3,it's like las vegas without the casinos,7:29,J,1,,
3,they say,7:30,J,1,,
3,the uae also ranks top three in the,7:33,J,1,,
3,world,7:34,J,1,,
3,for internet speeds according to,7:36,J,1,,
3,speedtest.net,7:37,J,1,,
3,coming in with an average download speed,7:39,J,1,,
3,of over 100 megabits per second,7:42,J,1,,
3,dubai also ranks highest in the middle,7:44,J,1,,
3,east on both,7:45,J,1,,
3,quality of life and infrastructure,7:48,J,1,,
3,according to the mercer index,7:50,J,1,,
3,one of the only downsides about living,7:52,J,1,,
3,in dubai is that the cost of living can,7:54,J,1,,
3,be high,7:55,J,1,,
3,ranging from 2 per month,7:58,J,1,,
3,to thirty five hundred dollars per month,8:00,J,1,,
3,for most expats and digital nomads but,8:03,J,1,,
3,this rate can be,8:04,J,1,,
3,much higher for families with a cost of,8:07,J,1,,
3,eight thousand,8:08,J,1,,
3,three hundred and fourteen dollars per,8:10,,,,
3,month according to nomad list,8:12,J,2,,
3,that being said the cost of living in,8:14,J,2,,
3,dubai is still,8:16,J,2,,
3,lower than it is in most u.s cities for,8:18,J,2,,
3,example,8:19,J,2,,
3,it ranks 14 lower than the cost of,8:22,J,2,,
3,living in miami,8:23,J,2,,
3,and 40 to 50 percent lower than living,8:26,J,2,,
3,in new york city,8:27,J,2,,
3,when it comes to quality of life,8:29,J,2,,
3,infrastructure business opportunities,8:31,J,2,,
3,and community dubai is definitely a,8:34,J,2,,
3,winner,8:35,J,2,,
3,the uae even has a state minister for,8:38,J,2,,
3,happiness and well-being,8:40,J,2,,
3,with the country aiming to be the,8:42,J,2,,
3,happiest country in the world,8:44,,,,
3,by 2021. so if you can weather those,8:48,,,,
3,hot desert temperatures and the higher,8:50,E,2,,
3,than average cost of living,8:52,E,2,,
3,dubai could be the place for you you can,8:55,E,2,,
3,learn more and apply for the digital,8:56,E,2,,

3,a like and subscribe and see you in the,9:20,F,3,,
4,subscribed and I'll see you guys on the,0:00,A,1,,
4,hey guys Chris here from Gold Coast,0:02,A,1,,
4,Australia today's video is about is the,0:06,A,1,,
4,location independent lifestyle for you,0:08,A,1,,
4,we're going to talk about some of the,0:10,A,1,,
4,pros and cons of the lifestyle and,0:12,,,,
4,dispel a few myths that you might have,0:15,A,2,,
4,heard a few misconceptions so that you,0:18,A,2,,
4,can have a better you know understanding,0:20,A,2,,
4,of what it is and whether you want to,0:21,A,2,,
4,get into it so this video is inspired by,0:24,A,2,,
4,life in Chiang Mai who left a comment on,0:27,A,2,,
4,my youtube video life outside and their,0:30,,,,
4,mind wanting to know more about the pros,0:32,A,3,,
4,and cons of being a digital no matter,0:35,A,3,,
4,living this lifestyle,0:36,A,3,,
4,so to quickly sum it up the location,0:38,A,3,,
4,independent lifestyle or the digital,0:40,A,3,,
4,Nomad lifestyle is one where you can,0:42,A,3,,
4,work anywhere using a computer and you,0:46,A,3,,
4,you can basically travel as much or as,0:48,A,3,,
4,little as you want,0:49,,,,
4,basically you can be location dependent,0:51,,,,
4,not travel at all but if for the,0:53,A,2,,
4,purposes of this video the location,0:55,A,2,,
4,independent lifestyle I'm basically,0:57,A,2,,
4,talking about being a digital nomad,0:59,A,2,,
4,working online and moving around from,1:02,A,2,,
4,place to place every now and then now,1:04,A,2,,
4,the title of this video is is the,1:06,A,2,,
4,location independent lifestyle for me,1:09,,,,
4,and the reason why it's called that is,1:11,G,2,A,2
4,because it's not for everyone you know,1:14,G,2,A,2
4,not everyone wants to mix the two wants,1:16,G,2,A,2
4,to mix travel and work there are,1:18,G,2,A,2
4,challenges on the road that you guys,1:21,G,2,A,2
4,should be aware of before you know,1:23,G,2,A,2
4,stepping into this or you know thinking,1:25,G,2,A,2
4,that this is the life for you all right,1:28,G,2,A,2
4,to start us off I want to get you guys,1:30,G,2,A,2
4,on the right page so what I'm going to,1:32,G,2,A,2
4,do is start with two big questions you,1:35,G,2,A,2
4,need to ask yourself before you even you,1:38,G,2,A,2
4,know take up this lifestyle or,1:40,,,,
4,consider pursuing it and the first,1:41,C,1,,
4,question is are you ready and willing to,1:44,C,1,,
4,work your ass off to achieve location,1:48,C,1,,
4,independence because you know some,1:49,C,1,,
4,people it does come too easy but for the,1:52,C,1,,
4,most part it's hard it's hard work the,1:55,C,1,,
4,it's a bit of a myth that you know being,1:57,C,1,,
4,a digital nomad is just a constant,1:59,C,1,,
4,holiday and you're not having to work or,2:02,A,2,C,2
4,that you stay in these cheap places and,2:04,A,2,C,2
4,it's so it's easy for some people,2:06,A,2,C,2
4,they've engineered it or they've got the,2:10,A,2,C,2
4,perfect lifestyle set up but for you,2:12,A,2,C,2
4,starting out,2:13,A,2,C,2
4,initially you're probably going to have,2:15,A,2,C,2
4,to work really hard to get in a really,2:18,A,2,C,2
4,comfortable position it's like anything,2:20,A,2,C,2
4,in life the location independent,2:22,A,2,C,2
4,lifestyle is not a free lunch you still,2:25,A,2,C,2
4,have to work and like I said if you've,2:27,A,2,C,2
4,got your things in order sometimes it is,2:29,A,2,C,2
4,like I did a podcast interview which,2:32,A,2,C,2
4,I'll link below with a good friend of,2:34,A,2,C,2
4,mine ghido,2:34,A,2,C,2
4,and he has nothing but good things to,2:36,A,2,C,2
4,say about you know being a digital nomad,2:39,A,2,C,2
4,but the difference is he built up an,2:41,A,2,C,2
4,experience of multiple years of you know,2:44,A,2,C,2
4,working as a developer and then he's,2:47,,,,
4,able to use that experience to get an,2:50,J,1,A,2
4,employer back home that will hire him,2:52,J,1,A,2
4,for three days a week pay him good money,2:54,J,1,A,2
4,and he basically lives in Thailand on,2:57,J,1,A,2
4,the cheap earning good money back home,2:59,J,1,A,2
4,and life is great but in that same,3:02,J,1,A,2
4,episode we talked to Mary yet guiteau's,3:05,J,1,A,2
4,girlfriend who hasn't built a career as,3:07,J,1,A,2
4,a developer over many years and so she's,3:10,J,1,A,2
4,just getting started and for her it's a,3:12,J,1,A,2
4,lot harder for somebody who's had a,3:14,S,1,C,2
4,location dependent career and done stuff,3:18,S,1,C,2
4,that's not digital at all it's going to,3:20,S,1,C,2
4,take a bit of time to transition into,3:22,S,1,C,2
4,that it's not going to be as simple as,3:24,S,1,C,2
4,jumping on up work and getting high paid,3:26,S,1,C,2
4,work straightaway for most people and,3:29,S,1,C,2
4,you know that's what I try to do with my,3:31,S,1,C,2
4,digital nomad vlogs is the biggest theme,3:34,S,1,C,2
4,of the digital Nomad vlogs are us,3:36,S,1,C,2
4,working and that's what I you know want,3:39,,,,
4,to show is that you can work remotely,3:42,,,,
4,and travel it's not us you know going on,3:45,,,,
4,tours all day every day and you know,3:47,D,2,,
4,lying by the beach I separate those,3:50,D,2,,
4,videos into separate travel vlogs those,3:52,D,2,,
4,are kind of like our weekends but during,3:54,D,2,,
4,the week we work very hard in fact you,3:57,D,2,,
4,know I've been known to be a pun space,3:59,D,2,,
4,for you know 12 hours a day pushing it,4:01,D,2,,
4,out working on you know client stuff,4:04,D,2,,
4,during the day and then at night working,4:06,,,,
4,on this project the Chris the freelancer,4:08,F,3,,
4,project so you know I work harder than I,4:10,F,3,,
4,probably need to by having my own,4:12,F,3,,
4,project but I'm highly passionate about,4:14,F,3,,
4,it,4:15,F,3,,
4,and I'm inspired to work so that's,4:17,F,3,,
4,something that a lot of people don't,4:19,F,3,,
4,understand is like why you know go away,4:21,F,3,,
4,and live this lifestyle if you just have,4:24,,,,
4,to work harder well it's different,4:25,,,,
4,you're working,4:27,,,,
4,more for yourself there's more,4:28,,,,
4,independence there's more freedom you,4:31,,,,
4,can you know there's more flexibility,4:33,,,,
4,and those are some of the things that,4:34,,,,
4,I'll go into in the pros and cons,4:36,,,,
4,section question number two is are you,4:39,,,,
4,willing to forego all the physical,4:42,A,3,,
4,possessions that you hold maybe it's,4:44,A,3,,
4,your big TV maybe it's your xbox,4:46,A,3,,
4,maybe it's your boat maybe it's things,4:48,A,3,,
4,that you just can't take with you,4:50,A,3,,
4,traveling it's not going to be practical,4:51,A,3,,
4,for long-term travel can you give those,4:54,A,3,,
4,up because I know that you know Denise,4:56,A,3,,
4,and I it was a real struggle even to get,4:59,A,3,,
4,luggage into two big suitcases and and,5:02,A,3,,
4,to like pretty good backpacks I thought,5:05,A,3,,
4,at the start of the year that we were,5:06,,,,
4,becoming minimalist but even that is not,5:08,,,,
4,really minimalist it's still a lot of,5:10,,,,
4,stuff and that we've had to cut around,5:12,S,2,,
4,this whole year and we are going to,5:14,S,2,,
4,downsize next year but that means that,5:16,S,2,,
4,we you know can't have as many things,5:18,S,2,,
4,and if you do decide to travel with a,5:21,S,2,,
4,lot of things you're going to have to,5:23,S,2,,
4,deal with that with transport and paying,5:26,S,2,,
4,the fees on the airlines for multiple,5:28,S,2,,
4,bags look you're not going to be able to,5:30,S,2,,
4,take absolutely everything with you so,5:32,S,2,,
4,if you can deal with that if you can be,5:35,S,2,,
4,somewhat of a minimalist then that's,5:37,S,2,,
4,okay you can continue to live this,5:39,S,2,,
4,lifestyle but if you have things like,5:41,S,2,,
4,these physical possessions that you just,5:43,S,2,,
4,can't live without and they're just too,5:45,S,2,,
4,big to fit in the suitcase or it's it's,5:47,S,2,,
4,just going to be impractical to travel,5:48,,,,
4,with unfortunately that's a big,5:51,,,,
4,consideration that you need to think of,5:52,,,,
4,before you go living a nomadic lifestyle,5:55,,,,
4,alright so now that those questions are,5:57,A,2,,
4,out of the way let's talk about the pros,5:58,A,2,,
4,and cons of this lifestyle so let's talk,6:01,A,2,,
4,about the pros first the pros are pretty,6:04,A,2,,
4,obvious the number one thing that I love,6:08,A,2,,
4,about it is the travel and the,6:10,A,2,,
4,flexibility of being able to move from,6:12,A,2,,
4,place to place for example here in,6:15,A,2,,
4,Australia I was living about an hour,6:18,A,2,,
4,away from here in a city called Brisbane,6:20,A,2,,
4,and minimum lease you can get on an,6:23,A,2,,
4,apartment there would probably be six,6:25,A,2,,
4,months if you're lucky but more likely,6:27,A,2,,
4,to be twelve months so you tied into a,6:30,A,2,,
4,contract and you you basically stuck,6:33,C,3,,
4,there for a year you take a job it's a,6:35,C,3,,
4,location dependent job and you're,6:37,C,3,,
4,expected to work there you know pay your,6:39,C,3,,
4,dues for a certain,6:40,C,3,,
4,a time you can't just pack up and leave,6:42,C,3,,
4,every you know two months so you know,6:45,C,3,,
4,places we stay like Chiang Mai anywhere,6:48,C,3,,
4,in Thailand Bali,6:49,C,3,,
4,these places we can come in for a month,6:52,C,3,,
4,we can come in for two weeks we're not,6:54,C,3,,
4,obliged to you know stay there in fact,6:56,C,3,,
4,we're tourists in those countries we,6:58,C,3,,
4,can't stay there for a really long time,7:00,,,,
4,without doing a border run or a visa run,7:03,,,,
4,and you know that's a negative as well,7:05,,,,
4,that I'll talk about but the positive of,7:07,A,3,,
4,that is just this unrivaled flexibility,7:09,A,3,,
4,and freedom to travel whenever you want,7:12,A,3,,
4,and not be tied down to any one place,7:14,A,3,,
4,another pro of the location independent,7:17,A,3,,
4,lifestyle is maybe you know maybe you,7:19,A,3,,
4,don't necessarily need to travel but you,7:22,A,3,,
4,want to get out of a situation you are,7:23,A,3,,
4,you have in your life here or maybe you,7:26,A,3,,
4,found in the more appropriate life,7:27,A,3,,
4,overseas for example you might want to,7:30,A,3,,
4,be an expat rather than say a digital,7:33,A,3,,
4,nomad and run an online business and,7:35,A,3,,
4,stay in the one place like we met a few,7:37,A,3,,
4,people in Chiang Mai who were there,7:40,A,3,,
4,for multiple multiple years are they,7:42,A,3,,
4,digital nomads you know where the,7:45,A,3,,
4,definition of nomadic you know turns to,7:47,A,3,,
4,expat I'm not quite sure but if you want,7:50,A,3,,
4,to like you know have you know an online,7:53,A,3,,
4,business or work online in order to,7:55,A,3,,
4,choose where you want to live and just,7:58,A,3,,
4,live somewhere outside your home country,7:59,A,3,,
4,you have that flexibility you have that,8:02,A,3,,
4,choice as well,8:03,,,,
4,the third Pro of course is geo arbitrage,8:06,E,2,,
4,and especially coming from you know a,8:09,E,2,,
4,country where the minimum wage is high,8:11,E,2,,
4,the currency is strong like Australia,8:13,E,2,,
4,and you know other Western countries you,8:16,E,2,,
4,can really leverage your currency to you,8:19,E,2,,
4,know live like a king as they say in,8:22,E,2,,
4,other places you know like you know,8:24,E,2,,
4,Thailand Malaysia Bali you know some,8:28,,,,
4,small wage back home might be considered,8:31,,,,
4,like a huge wage in those countries so,8:33,,,,
4,you can take advantage of that it's,8:35,,,,
4,called geo arbitrage and that manifests,8:38,A,2,,
4,in things like you know living in Chiang,8:40,A,2,,
4,Mai where the cost of living is low and,8:42,A,2,,
4,you can you know go to expensive dinners,8:45,A,2,,
4,every night like an expensive dinner in,8:47,A,2,,
4,Chiang Mai is you know 10 to 15 US,8:50,A,2,,
4,dollars that's like really expensive in,8:52,A,2,,
4,Chiang Mai,8:53,A,2,,
4,but for here an expensive dinner would,8:56,A,2,,
4,be like I don't know 25 US dollars or,9:00,A,2,,
4,more you know there's no limit and,9:01,A,2,,
4,another thing is just independence you,9:04,A,2,,
4,know in your business as well like if,9:06,A,2,,
4,you freelance you can you know for the,9:08,A,2,,
4,large part you can choose when to work,9:09,A,2,,
4,you don't want to work for a client,9:11,A,2,,
4,anymore you can just do that you can,9:13,A,2,,
4,work it wherever you want if you've set,9:15,A,2,,
4,it up right which you probably have if,9:17,A,2,,
4,you're moving around as a digital nomad,9:19,A,2,,
4,and just being able to choose who you,9:21,A,2,,
4,work with where you work what times you,9:23,A,2,,
4,work you know there's a different levels,9:26,A,2,,
4,of that in terms of what job you have or,9:28,A,2,,
4,what career you have but just being able,9:30,F,3,,
4,to control your own schedule control,9:31,F,3,,
4,where you stay have that independence,9:34,F,3,,
4,and kind of own your own business even,9:36,F,3,,
4,if you're working for somebody else so,9:38,F,3,,
4,some of the cons of the lifestyle one,9:41,F,3,,
4,big one that I found is like you can't,9:43,F,3,,
4,find a job on the ground so oftentimes,9:45,F,3,,
4,when you're digital nomads most of the,9:47,F,3,,
4,time you are on a tourist visa and those,9:51,F,3,,
4,tourist visas do not allow you to do,9:52,,,,
4,business or have a job in that actual,9:55,,,,
4,country so like you're always restricted,9:58,,,,
4,to making money online and sometimes you,10:00,,,,
4,know you may want to actually have a,10:03,,,,
4,physical job in a physical location you,10:06,F,3,,
4,know sometimes when I'm in Australia and,10:08,F,3,,
4,I want a bit of extra cash I can go,10:09,F,3,,
4,drive uber I can't do that even though,10:12,F,3,,
4,Uber exists overseas I can't do that,10:15,F,3,,
4,because I'm not legally allowed to work,10:17,F,3,,
4,in that country so it's good thing in a,10:20,F,3,,
4,way having the restriction that you can,10:21,F,3,,
4,only work online but bad in another way,10:24,F,3,,
4,that maybe you do want to have a job on,10:26,,,,
4,the ground but unfortunately as a,10:28,,,,
4,tourist and moving around often it's,10:31,Q,2,A,1
4,going to be hard to do that and just on,10:32,Q,2,A,1
4,the tourist thing another con is that,10:34,Q,2,A,1
4,you have to move even if you don't want,10:37,Q,2,A,1
4,to so you know nomads have to do things,10:40,Q,2,A,1
4,called border runs and visa runs which,10:43,Q,2,A,1
4,is basically a border run is when it,10:46,Q,2,A,1
4,says on your visa that you have to leave,10:47,Q,2,A,1
4,but you can come straight back and a,10:49,Q,2,A,1
4,visa run is you know you leave the,10:52,Q,2,A,1
4,country to go get another visa to,10:54,Q,2,A,1
4,re-enter and for people that have been,10:56,Q,2,A,1
4,doing like staying in the one place for,10:59,Q,2,A,1
4,a long time this gets really frustrating,11:02,Q,2,A,1
4,having to go for two to three months in,11:04,Q,2,A,1
4,a place and then having to leave and,11:06,Q,2,A,1
4,have,11:06,Q,2,A,1
4,to come back so you have to do minimum,11:08,Q,2,A,1
4,three trips a year and also like extend,11:10,Q,2,A,1
4,this is I'm talking about Thailand,11:12,,,,
4,specifically with the three-month thing,11:15,,,,
4,but certain countries you know you might,11:16,,,,
4,only be able to stay there a month you,11:18,,,,
4,might have there's a there's a Zone in,11:21,E,2,,
4,the European Union where you can only,11:23,E,2,,
4,travel three months every six months so,11:27,E,2,,
4,kind of stuff like that is like if you,11:29,E,2,,
4,get settled and you don't want to travel,11:31,E,2,,
4,you're still a tourist so you still have,11:33,E,2,,
4,to move around the third con is,11:35,E,2,,
4,something that affects a lot of people,11:37,E,2,,
4,and that's transient relationships so,11:39,E,2,,
4,you're traveling or maybe you're staying,11:42,E,2,,
4,in the one place but you know a majority,11:44,E,2,,
4,of the people you're going to meet,11:45,E,2,,
4,they're going to be traveling as well,11:47,E,2,,
4,and so you might make great friends you,11:49,E,2,,
4,might meet people that you really like,11:51,E,2,,
4,and then you know two weeks later,11:53,E,2,,
4,they're off to somewhere else and you,11:55,E,2,,
4,know that can be a positive as well,11:57,E,2,,
4,because maybe you're traveling to some,11:59,E,2,,
4,you know other place and oh look who's,12:01,E,2,,
4,there it's a friend who you met you know,12:03,E,2,,
4,in another place and we've had that,12:05,E,2,,
4,multiple times where we've met people in,12:08,E,2,,
4,one place and then bumped into them in a,12:11,E,2,,
4,completely different City somewhere else,12:13,,,,
4,in Asia so that does happen but you know,12:16,,,,
4,you're not always going to have the same,12:18,H,2,A,1
4,friends around you most of the time,12:20,H,2,A,1
4,unless you hang out with expats and stay,12:23,H,2,A,1
4,in the one place but if you're moving,12:24,H,2,A,1
4,around a lot you know it's a big issue,12:26,H,2,A,1
4,of this transient relationships and,12:28,H,2,A,1
4,especially for romantic relationships,12:31,H,2,A,1
4,this can be a really big issue because,12:33,H,2,A,1
4,what happens if you find a you know a,12:35,H,2,A,1
4,lady friend or male friend that you,12:37,H,2,A,1
4,really like and you know maybe you want,12:39,H,2,A,1
4,to get serious about it but then what,12:41,H,2,A,1
4,happens she's going this direction he's,12:43,H,2,A,1
4,going that direction,12:44,H,2,A,1
4,what can you do you know another one is,12:47,H,2,A,1
4,being away from your friends and family,12:49,H,2,A,1
4,this is something that my girlfriend,12:51,H,2,A,1
4,Denise deals with a lot she feels the,12:53,H,2,A,1
4,need to be close to her family and so,12:55,H,2,A,1
4,depending on how far away we're just in,12:58,H,2,A,1
4,Asia so it's not too far away but we're,13:01,H,2,A,1
4,planning to go to Europe next year and,13:03,H,2,A,1
4,to be that far away from your family for,13:06,H,2,A,1
4,a long period of time it may not be,13:08,H,2,A,1
4,something that you want to do so that's,13:10,H,2,A,1
4,a consideration as well another con,13:12,H,2,A,1
4,which actually somebody messaged me in a,13:15,,,,
4,private message and you know talked to,13:17,,,,
4,me about this is is the benefits you get,13:20,,,,
4,having a job so like this is more,13:23,,,,
4,prevalent in the United States where you,13:24,,,,
4,know you'll get your 401k and you'll get,13:27,,,,
4,your health insurance as a part of your,13:29,,,,
4,package of your employment and,13:32,C,1,,
4,oftentimes those benefits can be way too,13:34,C,1,,
4,expensive to pay for outside of the job,13:38,C,1,,
4,and you know for those Americans we're,13:41,C,1,,
4,quite fortunate in Australia that we do,13:43,C,1,,
4,have a lot of public benefits but,13:44,C,1,,
4,especially while I'm traveling you know,13:47,C,1,,
4,my health insurance isn't going to cover,13:48,C,1,,
4,me if I get sick and end up at a Thai,13:51,C,1,,
4,hospital for example which is what,13:52,C,1,,
4,happened this year I had to contact my,13:55,C,1,,
4,travel insurance which is another tip is,13:58,C,1,,
4,to get travel insurance but in terms of,14:00,C,1,,
4,benefits you have to manage your own,14:02,C,1,,
4,business so you have to pay for your own,14:03,C,1,,
4,retirement you have to pay for your own,14:05,C,1,,
4,tax you have to manage that so it's not,14:09,C,1,,
4,as easy as having a job and having those,14:11,C,1,,
4,benefits having those tax obligations,14:13,,,,
4,taken care of the next con is that you,14:16,,,,
4,can work anywhere and everywhere and,14:18,A,1,,
4,that sounds like a pro and it is but,14:20,A,1,,
4,there's a downside to that and the con,14:22,A,1,,
4,of being able to work anywhere and,14:24,A,1,,
4,everywhere is sometimes you're expected,14:27,A,1,,
4,to work at any time you know some,14:29,A,1,,
4,there's always the the temptation to to,14:32,A,1,,
4,work at any time or have your clients,14:34,A,1,,
4,demand that you work at any time Denise,14:37,A,1,,
4,for example you know has clients in,14:40,A,1,,
4,Australia so when were on a time zone in,14:42,A,1,,
4,Asia she might have to get up at 5 or 6,14:45,A,1,,
4,a.m. in the morning to do in a meeting,14:47,A,1,,
4,that on the time zone here is completely,14:50,A,1,,
4,reasonable but for her it's like has to,14:53,A,1,,
4,get up really early in the morning and,14:54,A,1,,
4,then you know she ends up taking a nap,14:56,A,1,,
4,it's not a big deal,14:58,A,1,,
4,but for a lot of people you know that's,15:00,A,1,,
4,that's a consideration as well another,15:02,A,1,,
4,con is the lack of consistency and just,15:05,,,,
4,having to recalibrate everywhere your,15:08,,,,
4,new place you go like you know this is a,15:10,,,,
4,flipside of you know life being boring,15:12,G,1,,
4,and stable here is that you know,15:14,G,1,,
4,everything's reliable you know where,15:16,G,1,,
4,you're staying you know where you're,15:17,G,1,,
4,working you know how to get internet you,15:19,G,1,,
4,know where to eat when you go to a new,15:22,G,1,,
4,country or a new place or a new city you,15:24,G,1,,
4,you might arrive there and like oh where,15:27,G,1,,
4,can I get working Wi-Fi you know big,15:29,G,1,,
4,things that digital nomads need food,15:31,G,1,,
4,shelter and Wi-Fi you know,15:33,G,1,,
4,certain countries don't have good,15:35,G,1,,
4,internet you know certain countries,15:37,G,1,,
4,certain cities might have a lack of,15:39,G,1,,
4,internet you need to always be,15:41,G,1,,
4,considering Oh is this place going to be,15:43,G,1,,
4,have a good connection am I going to,15:46,G,1,,
4,find places to work from you know we've,15:48,G,1,,
4,gone to cafes sometimes and you know on,15:51,,,,
4,the blog's online it says yeah they've,15:53,D,1,,
4,got good internet and you get there and,15:54,D,1,,
4,this is oh sorry no internet and I mean,15:56,D,1,,
4,if you've got a deadline you've got a,15:57,D,1,,
4,client meeting that yeah it's not good,16:01,D,1,,
4,to have that kind of unreliability it's,16:03,D,1,,
4,exciting sometimes you know not knowing,16:06,D,1,,
4,you arrive in a place and not knowing,16:07,D,1,,
4,what's going to happen but sometimes you,16:09,D,1,,
4,just need to be reliable especially with,16:12,D,1,,
4,work side of things you need to know,16:14,D,1,,
4,that you can get Wi-Fi you can get set,16:16,D,1,,
4,up and you can get straight to work and,16:18,D,1,,
4,the last con is feeling like you need to,16:21,D,1,,
4,have a base and I think if there's any,16:23,D,1,,
4,thing that's like really common of any,16:26,,,,
4,long-term nomads is they end up going to,16:29,,,,
4,the same places or staying in the same,16:31,,,,
4,place for longer periods of time as they,16:35,,,,
4,find places that they like or maybe they,16:37,,,,
4,just want to stay at home and that's,16:39,Q,2,N,3
4,because you travel for long enough you,16:41,Q,2,N,3
4,feel like you need a base you need a,16:43,Q,2,N,3
4,home and maybe some people don't feel,16:46,Q,2,N,3
4,the need for it but a lot of people do,16:47,Q,2,N,3
4,and so that home can be your home,16:50,Q,2,N,3
4,country or it can be a place you find on,16:53,Q,2,N,3
4,the road when we're traveling in Asia,16:54,Q,2,N,3
4,you know we use Chiang Mai as a base,16:57,Q,2,N,3
4,it's a very reliable city we know,16:59,Q,2,N,3
4,there's going to be good internet we,17:00,Q,2,N,3
4,know our friends are there it's great,17:03,Q,2,N,3
4,it's a central location but I think,17:05,Q,2,N,3
4,that's that's not necessarily a con more,17:07,Q,2,N,3
4,so a consideration that as you're,17:10,Q,2,N,3
4,traveling you'll probably want to find a,17:12,Q,2,N,3
4,base or you know use your home as a base,17:15,Q,2,N,3
4,so there you go a few pros and cons of,17:17,Q,2,N,3
4,the lifestyle if you can think of any,17:20,Q,2,N,3
4,more that I haven't touched on or you're,17:22,,,,
4,going to need questions definitely leave,17:24,,,,
4,them in the comments below and if you're,17:26,A,3,,
4,still wondering is this lifestyle for me,17:29,A,3,,
4,I don't know,17:30,A,3,,
4,the cons sound pretty bad the pros sound,17:32,A,3,,
4,good just give it a go you know I mean,17:34,A,3,,
4,like if you've never been travelling for,17:35,A,3,,
4,before in your life I definitely,17:37,A,3,,
4,consider doing some overseas travel,17:39,A,3,,
4,first and seeing if you like it maybe,17:41,A,3,,
4,doing some long-term travel and just,17:43,A,3,,
4,ease your way into it you don't have to,17:45,A,3,,
4,you know sell all your stuff and,17:47,A,3,,
4,to Thailand today you know and that's,17:49,A,3,,
4,not mom saying at all,17:50,A,3,,
4,you know and some people have done that,17:53,,,,
4,but you don't have to do that you know,17:55,,,,
4,also if you enjoyed this video please,17:57,,,,
4,give a big thumbs up I'm starting to ask,18:00,F,3,,
4,you guys for that now because I've been,18:02,F,3,,
4,totally neglecting that so if you like,18:04,F,3,,
4,it thumbs up please and coming up on the,18:06,F,3,,
4,channel I'm going to be going down to,18:08,F,3,,
4,Melbourne Denise's meeting with a client,18:10,F,3,,
4,so you know stay tuned to the channel,18:12,F,3,,
4,I've taken your feedback from the last,18:15,F,3,,
4,vlog and hopefully going to put some of,18:17,F,3,,
4,those things in the next one so yeah,18:19,F,3,,
4,stay tuned stay motivated stay,18:21,F,3,,
5,or I might add it to another Q&A type,0:00,F,3,,
5,hey guys Chris here at puns space in,0:08,F,3,,
5,Chiang Mai Thailand I'm here doing this,0:10,F,3,,
5,video at pants base because I thought,0:12,F,3,,
5,this would be the most appropriate place,0:14,F,3,,
5,to do it adds this co-working space is,0:17,,,,
5,one of the biggest hotspots for digital,0:19,A,2,,
5,nomads in the world basically so today,0:23,A,2,,
5,I'm going to be answering a question,0:24,A,2,,
5,from a viewer that I got on Twitter,0:27,A,2,,
5,actually so this viewer asked I'm,0:29,A,2,,
5,definitely inspired by your YouTube,0:31,A,2,,
5,channel I'm currently exploring all my,0:33,,,,
5,options on becoming a digital nomad,0:35,C,1,,
5,where to start and look that's a that's,0:38,C,1,,
5,a huge question and there's literally so,0:41,C,1,,
5,many paths you can take to sort of,0:44,C,1,,
5,living this lifestyle,0:45,C,1,,
5,but I thought how to answer this,0:47,C,1,,
5,question is I'm going to provide a,0:49,C,1,,
5,framework for you guys a bit of a,0:51,C,1,,
5,roadmap and but you can choose your path,0:54,,,,
5,within it so I'm going to lay out all,0:56,,,,
5,the options and you guys can choose you,1:00,A,2,,
5,know what makes sense for you so,1:02,A,2,,
5,throughout this video I'm going to be,1:04,A,2,,
5,following the four steps that I talked,1:06,A,2,,
5,about in my free guide to location,1:08,A,2,,
5,independence that you can find here and,1:10,A,2,,
5,basically the guide gives you four steps,1:13,A,2,,
5,to achieving location independence but I,1:15,A,2,,
5,guess this video we're going to go a,1:16,A,2,D,2
5,little bit deeper into the money-making,1:18,A,2,D,2
5,stuff and take a more visual approach to,1:21,A,2,D,2
5,showing you guys the process so first,1:23,A,2,D,2
5,things first we need to define the term,1:26,A,2,D,2
5,digital nomad and sort of break it up,1:30,A,2,D,2
5,so in digital nomad to me it's got two,1:32,A,2,D,2
5,components,1:33,A,2,D,2
5,you've got the digital side and you've,1:34,A,2,D,2
5,got the nomadic side right digital means,1:37,A,2,D,2
5,you work in some sort of digital field,1:39,A,2,D,2
5,you're making money online basically and,1:41,A,2,D,2
5,the nomadic side means that you're,1:44,,,,
5,living somewhere outside your country,1:46,D,1,,
5,you're not in a fixed location for a,1:49,D,1,,
5,long period of time you might be,1:50,D,1,,
5,traveling you might be living six months,1:53,D,1,,
5,in a different country and then six,1:54,D,1,,
5,months in another country but you're,1:56,D,1,,
5,living a somewhat nomadic life so that,2:00,D,1,,
5,actually goes quite well into the four,2:02,D,1,,
5,steps so if we take a look at the,2:04,D,2,C,2
5,diagram I've broken it up in the two,2:07,D,2,C,2
5,sections the digital part make money on,2:09,D,2,C,2
5,and the second part is the nomadic part,2:11,D,2,C,2
5,so the first step to being a digital,2:14,D,2,C,2
5,nomad is you're going to need some sort,2:15,D,2,C,2
5,of skills you might have these skills,2:17,D,2,C,2
5,already but you might be starting from,2:18,D,2,C,2
5,scratch either way is fine but there's,2:21,D,2,C,2
5,kind of two ways you can go about this,2:23,D,2,C,2
5,you can find free resources or maybe pay,2:27,D,2,C,2
5,a little bit of money online to somebody,2:30,D,2,C,2
5,to teach you this through the internet,2:32,D,2,C,2
5,basically and then the second option is,2:34,D,2,C,2
5,to get a formal education so let's go,2:36,D,2,C,2
5,through the options for finding a course,2:38,D,2,C,2
5,online what I did was I went to,2:40,D,2,C,2
5,lynda.com which is this online training,2:44,D,2,C,2
5,library it's got everything from web,2:46,D,2,C,2
5,design to photography to you know app,2:49,D,2,C,2
5,development business stuff as well I,2:53,,,,
5,highly recommend it it's what I use to,2:55,J,1,A,2
5,learn how to code basically and if you,2:57,J,1,A,2
5,want to know more about learning how to,2:58,J,1,A,2
5,code definitely check out my previous,3:00,J,1,A,2
5,video on how I learnt to code,3:03,J,1,A,2
5,there's also udemy unlike Lynda where,3:06,J,1,A,2
5,the authors are hired by Lynda to do the,3:09,J,1,A,2
5,the courses and build the library udemy,3:12,J,1,A,2
5,is a course marketplace so if you or I,3:16,J,1,A,2
5,want to do a course or anyone we can,3:18,J,1,A,2
5,make one we put it on you to me and you,3:20,S,1,C,2
5,to me and the course creators for the,3:23,S,1,C,2
5,profits basically so what that means for,3:25,S,1,C,2
5,you guys is that you have to make sure,3:27,S,1,C,2
5,you're choosing a good udemy course and,3:30,S,1,C,2
5,you can generally find this by looking,3:31,S,1,C,2
5,at the star rating in the comments and,3:35,S,1,C,2
5,the number of enrolled users to see if,3:37,S,1,C,2
5,it's a legit course or it's just some,3:40,S,1,C,2
5,guy who thinks he knows a thing or two,3:42,S,1,C,2
5,and throws it online,3:43,,,,
5,Linda and udemy are probably two of the,3:45,,,,
5,biggest options but there are hundreds,3:47,,,,
5,of other places,3:48,D,2,,
5,I know specifically with the code,3:50,D,2,,
5,learning code stuff there's free code,3:53,D,2,,
5,camp com code academy.com those are both,3:58,D,2,,
5,free but if you want to pay a little bit,4:00,D,2,,
5,extra you can get really cheap,4:02,D,2,,
5,memberships to sites like code school,4:04,D,2,,
5,and tree house for the other stuff just,4:08,D,2,,
5,do a search on google try and find,4:10,,,,
5,courses on you know if you want to do,4:12,F,3,,
5,copywriting if you want to do digital,4:14,F,3,,
5,marketing you can find a course for,4:17,F,3,,
5,pretty much anything digital online the,4:19,F,3,,
5,second stream of options is is to get a,4:21,F,3,,
5,formal,4:22,F,3,,
5,and I do not recommend this at all,4:25,F,3,,
5,basically universities weren't set up to,4:30,F,3,,
5,sort of facilitate people to take this,4:33,,,,
5,lifestyle to to live this lifestyle to,4:35,,,,
5,work online travel be remote so if,4:38,,,,
5,that's your plan you're probably not,4:40,,,,
5,going to find the best education and the,4:43,,,,
5,other thing about it is it's going to,4:44,,,,
5,take lots of time and lots of money,4:47,,,,
5,and by the end of a three-year degree,4:49,,,,
5,half the course material is probably,4:51,,,,
5,going to be out of date anyway because,4:52,A,3,,
5,this digital world is moving so fast,4:55,A,3,,
5,yeah I highly recommend going with a,4:59,A,3,,
5,course online and kind of teaching,5:00,A,3,,
5,yourself alright step two you've built,5:03,A,3,,
5,some skills but now you've got to get,5:05,A,3,,
5,paid for those skills so how do you do,5:07,A,3,,
5,it for me there's three options number,5:09,A,3,,
5,one you've got a remote job and the,5:12,A,3,,
5,easiest most reliable way of you know,5:15,A,3,,
5,getting a remote job to me is getting,5:18,A,3,,
5,hired with a local third firm with the,5:20,,,,
5,option of going remote and this is what,5:22,,,,
5,my friend Dillon did I've got an,5:24,,,,
5,interview with Dillon here on the blog,5:26,S,2,,
5,and also I'm getting together with,5:28,S,2,,
5,Dillon to do a Q&A answering you guys,5:30,S,2,,
5,questions on web development so if you,5:34,S,2,,
5,have any questions about that definitely,5:35,S,2,,
5,comment below send me a message,5:38,S,2,,
5,but basically what he did was he found a,5:39,S,2,,
5,firm in his hometown of Melbourne,5:42,S,2,,
5,Australia this firm had remote teams,5:44,S,2,,
5,like they hide remotely so he worked for,5:47,S,2,,
5,them for like three months and then went,5:49,S,2,,
5,remote and he still does that to this,5:51,S,2,,
5,day the other option of getting a remote,5:53,S,2,,
5,job is applying just for any remote job,5:55,S,2,,
5,so anywhere in the world the upside to,5:57,S,2,,
5,that is that there's more jobs available,5:59,S,2,,
5,obviously because it's anywhere in the,6:01,S,2,,
5,world but the downside is you're going,6:03,,,,
5,to be competing against everyone in the,6:05,,,,
5,world and when you start competing on,6:07,,,,
5,price that's when you're gonna you know,6:10,,,,
5,really earn less especially if you're,6:12,A,2,,
5,from you know Western country like,6:14,A,2,,
5,Australia UK Canada America New Zealand,6:18,A,2,,
5,if you're competing with offshore,6:19,A,2,,
5,workers that are you know from the,6:21,A,2,,
5,Philippines or India that work generally,6:24,A,2,,
5,under ten US dollars an hour then you,6:27,A,2,,
5,know you might not be getting enough,6:29,A,2,,
5,money to even make it worth your while,6:30,A,2,,
5,that being said if you were an expert in,6:33,A,2,,
5,your field you can probably get a remote,6:36,A,2,,
5,pretty easy because there's plenty of,6:39,A,2,,
5,remote jobs out there for highly,6:41,A,2,,
5,experienced people because you know,6:44,A,2,,
5,talent is hard to come by in the digital,6:46,C,3,,
5,world so they're willing to hire,6:48,C,3,,
5,remotely if you're highly talented the,6:50,C,3,,
5,third option with the remote job stuff,6:52,C,3,,
5,is to negotiate with your current,6:54,C,3,,
5,employer a remote work agreement and,6:58,C,3,,
5,that's going to be for most people the,7:00,C,3,,
5,hardest thing because some employers,7:02,C,3,,
5,aren't going to budge especially like,7:04,C,3,,
5,the culture in Australia is definitely,7:06,C,3,,
5,not one where people are used to the,7:09,C,3,,
5,idea of hiring remotely so you're,7:11,C,3,,
5,probably not going to be likely to,7:14,C,3,,
5,achieve that but if you can negotiate,7:17,,,,
5,with your work or or you do something,7:20,,,,
5,you know that can go remote and you,7:21,,,,
5,think your boss might be open to it I,7:23,A,3,,
5,recommend checking out the 4-hour work,7:25,A,3,,
5,week this book is the Bible when it,7:28,A,3,,
5,comes to being a digital nomad you need,7:30,A,3,,
5,to read it and read the section on how,7:33,A,3,,
5,you can negotiate a remote work position,7:36,A,3,,
5,with your current employer the second,7:38,A,3,,
5,stream of options is freelancing and a,7:41,A,3,,
5,lot of people take this option and one,7:43,A,3,,
5,of the biggest reasons is that there's a,7:45,A,3,,
5,new way of doing it there's these online,7:47,A,3,,
5,freelancing platforms like up work,7:49,A,3,,
5,people per our gurus calm and basically,7:53,A,3,,
5,you can either you know bid for jobs,7:56,A,3,,
5,send in your price send in your proposal,7:58,A,3,,
5,and apply for jobs that somebody else,8:01,A,3,,
5,has posted or perhaps you can get,8:04,A,3,,
5,contacted directly based off your,8:06,A,3,,
5,profile from the employers themselves,8:08,A,3,,
5,and invited to apply basically the other,8:11,A,3,,
5,method of freelancing is more suited to,8:14,A,3,,
5,people that have built up you know,8:16,A,3,,
5,skills experience reputation and that's,8:18,A,3,,
5,you know running your own sort of,8:20,A,3,,
5,freelance business and the reason why,8:22,,,,
5,you'd want to have a network an existing,8:25,D,2,,
5,network and reputation is because this,8:28,D,2,,
5,is kind of a model where people find you,8:30,D,2,,
5,and want to hire you specifically that's,8:33,D,2,,
5,great if you can do that but as somebody,8:36,D,2,,
5,starting out that's going to be pretty,8:37,D,2,,
5,hard unless you're really awesome at,8:39,D,2,,
5,what you do because you need to build,8:41,D,2,,
5,this brand where people are going to,8:43,,,,
5,hire you specifically not just hire on,8:47,,,,
5,the best price available,8:48,,,,
5,or just anyone that can do the job the,8:50,,,,
5,third stream of course is starting an,8:52,A,2,,
5,online business and this is the most,8:55,A,2,,
5,risky choice you can make but also the,8:58,A,2,,
5,highest reward so if you want to achieve,9:02,A,2,,
5,location independence in the most,9:03,A,2,,
5,reliable fashion possible you probably,9:06,A,2,,
5,want to go for a remote job but if you,9:08,A,2,,
5,want to really be successful and you,9:10,A,2,,
5,don't mind like maybe failing a few,9:13,A,2,,
5,times and you're okay with say maybe,9:15,A,2,,
5,failing a bunch of times before you,9:17,A,2,,
5,actually achieve that success and you,9:19,A,2,,
5,only want to travel with good income,9:21,A,2,,
5,then online business might be for you it,9:25,A,2,,
5,probably is for you actually so I've got,9:27,A,2,,
5,a few examples here one that's really,9:29,A,2,,
5,popular around here at pun space is drop,9:32,A,2,,
5,shipping and drop shipping is the idea,9:34,A,2,,
5,that you sell a physical product but,9:37,A,2,,
5,instead of managing the inventory,9:39,A,2,,
5,yourself you get the supplier to ship it,9:41,A,2,,
5,direct to the customer so as you can,9:43,A,2,,
5,imagine you just focus on the client,9:45,A,2,,
5,facing the customer facing aspect of the,9:47,A,2,,
5,business and you just need your laptop,9:50,A,3,,
5,and then you forward the order the,9:52,A,3,,
5,supplier supplier takes care of it you,9:54,A,3,,
5,don't have to handle anything physically,9:56,A,3,,
5,which is perfect for this kind of,9:58,A,3,,
5,lifestyle which is why a lot of people,10:00,A,3,,
5,do it another idea is selling info,10:02,A,3,,
5,products info products like ebooks,10:05,A,3,,
5,courses anything where you have these,10:07,A,3,,
5,knowledge or skills or could teach,10:09,A,3,,
5,people something or have something,10:11,A,3,,
5,valuable to share you can put that into,10:13,A,3,,
5,a product and people can download it and,10:15,,,,
5,you don't need to ship any physical,10:16,,,,
5,products or anything like that with the,10:18,,,,
5,online business stuff there's obviously,10:20,F,3,,
5,countless other ways those are just two,10:22,F,3,,
5,ideas but if you want to know more about,10:25,F,3,,
5,the online business stuff I can,10:26,F,3,,
5,definitely get some like experts on the,10:29,F,3,,
5,channel and we can you know answer,10:31,F,3,,
5,specific questions with that so let me,10:33,F,3,,
5,know the alternative method which we,10:35,F,3,,
5,won't be discussing is investing if,10:37,F,3,,
5,you're planning on investing you,10:39,,,,
5,probably should listen to investment,10:42,,,,
5,advice not me because I'm not an,10:44,Q,2,A,1
5,investor but if you've got some income,10:47,Q,2,A,1
5,coming in from investments definitely,10:49,Q,2,A,1
5,listen to this second part which is,10:52,Q,2,A,1
5,being nomadic so I've got it down two,10:55,Q,2,A,1
5,steps three and four,10:57,Q,2,A,1
5,step three is eliminate the barriers to,11:00,Q,2,A,1
5,freedom so,11:02,Q,2,A,1
5,I've got four most common ones here,11:04,Q,2,A,1
5,you've got financial commitments,11:05,Q,2,A,1
5,relationship commitments over reliance,11:08,Q,2,A,1
5,on physical possessions and fear so the,11:11,Q,2,A,1
5,financial commitments it might be you,11:13,Q,2,A,1
5,have mortgage or you have a lease on a,11:15,Q,2,A,1
5,property or you've got some kind of,11:17,Q,2,A,1
5,contract where you need to pay off you,11:19,Q,2,A,1
5,need to pay the bills basically the best,11:22,Q,2,A,1
5,way to do it is to fulfill those,11:24,Q,2,A,1
5,obligations first and then go nomadic,11:28,Q,2,A,1
5,basically the second one is relationship,11:30,,,,
5,commitments and this is one that I,11:32,,,,
5,haven't really struggled with I had a,11:35,,,,
5,serious girlfriend when I left and still,11:37,,,,
5,do and the great thing about my,11:39,A,2,,
5,girlfriend is that she wanted to live,11:41,A,2,,
5,this lifestyle as well so it I didn't,11:43,A,2,,
5,have to make the choice between my my,11:46,A,2,,
5,girlfriend and this lifestyle I'm lucky,11:49,A,2,,
5,in that regard I found since I've been,11:50,A,2,,
5,here but you might have to make a choice,11:53,A,2,,
5,between your relationship and going you,11:57,A,2,,
5,know in taking this lifestyle I'm not,11:59,A,2,,
5,here to tell you what to do but if you,12:01,A,2,,
5,want something bad enough you will take,12:05,A,2,,
5,the necessary steps to achieve it so you,12:07,A,2,,
5,might have to make a choice between a,12:11,A,2,,
5,relationship and this lifestyle but if,12:14,A,2,,
5,you can have both definitely have both,12:17,A,2,,
5,the one over reliance on physical,12:19,A,2,,
5,possessions now I've had a few people,12:22,A,2,,
5,that have been like oh yes the digital,12:24,A,2,,
5,nomad lifestyle definitely want to live,12:26,A,2,,
5,that yet you know their apartment is,12:28,A,2,,
5,full of stuff that they rely on daily,12:31,A,2,,
5,they can't live without their you know,12:32,A,2,,
5,44 inch flat screen TV or however big it,12:36,A,2,,
5,is and they you know need like a special,12:40,A,2,,
5,room with like recording equipment maybe,12:42,,,,
5,they're a musician let's say there are,12:43,,,,
5,musician or they they do some kind of,12:46,H,2,A,1
5,DIY stuff and you know they need their,12:49,H,2,A,1
5,garage to work on stuff you know nearly,12:51,H,2,A,1
5,everyday well that's going to be hard to,12:54,H,2,A,1
5,maintain while you're traveling or even,12:57,H,2,A,1
5,if you move somewhere else you know like,12:59,H,2,A,1
5,having that specific room making sure,13:02,H,2,A,1
5,you have all those creature comforts is,13:04,H,2,A,1
5,going to be a lot harder but the good,13:06,H,2,A,1
5,thing about this lifestyle is it's good,13:08,H,2,A,1
5,opportunity to practice something called,13:09,H,2,A,1
5,having,13:13,H,2,A,1
5,minimalism which is focusing on only,13:13,H,2,A,1
5,things that you actually need not the,13:16,H,2,A,1
5,things that you think you need but you,13:19,H,2,A,1
5,don't really need so it's actually a,13:21,H,2,A,1
5,good exercise in minimalism to go,13:23,H,2,A,1
5,travelling take what you need and as,13:26,H,2,A,1
5,over time you'll see that you actually,13:28,H,2,A,1
5,don't need a lot of those things that,13:30,H,2,A,1
5,you think you need,13:31,H,2,A,1
5,finally fear this is a big one and it's,13:34,A,1,N,
5,such a simple thing but it holds so many,13:36,A,1,N,2
5,people back and especially like if,13:40,A,1,N,2
5,you're older person and you know society,13:43,A,1,N,2
5,doesn't really support you you know,13:46,A,1,N,2
5,packing up and leaving or being nomadic,13:48,,,,2
5,you know people might you know turn up,13:51,,,,
5,their nose at you or something you just,13:53,,,,
5,got to get past that really I mean if,13:55,,,,
5,it's something that you want you know it,13:57,,,,
5,shouldn't matter what other people think,13:58,,,,
5,like if you want to live this lifestyle,14:00,,,,
5,go after it,14:02,C,1,,
5,you know if feel the fear and do it,14:04,C,1,,
5,anyway usually at the end of on the,14:07,C,1,,
5,other side of fear is you know,14:08,C,1,,
5,achievement and growth alright so step,14:11,C,1,,
5,four and this is the one I think is the,14:12,C,1,,
5,most fun is choosing your locations and,14:15,C,1,,
5,there's only really two criteria that,14:18,C,1,,
5,your locations need to be and the rest,14:20,C,1,,
5,is up to personal preference so number,14:23,C,1,,
5,one you want your location to be,14:24,C,1,,
5,affordable so there's the reason why so,14:27,C,1,,
5,many people are in Shanghai is for,14:29,C,1,,
5,anyone on a Western salary or you know,14:31,C,1,,
5,even half of Western salary Chiangmai is,14:35,C,1,,
5,very affordable we're choosing a,14:37,C,1,,
5,location becomes a problem is if you say,14:39,C,1,,
5,I want to live in London and you know,14:42,C,1,,
5,London is like one of the most expensive,14:44,,,,
5,cities in the world and you've got to,14:46,,,,
5,make sure that you have enough income to,14:49,A,1,,
5,sustain yourself living there so it,14:52,A,1,,
5,might actually be a painful process for,14:54,A,1,,
5,your choosing your locations if you feel,14:56,A,1,,
5,like you have to compromise on the,14:58,A,1,,
5,places you want to go maybe you want to,15:00,A,1,,
5,go everywhere in Western Europe but you,15:02,A,1,,
5,can only really afford Southeast Asia I,15:04,A,1,,
5,actually like Southeast Asia and want to,15:07,A,1,,
5,be here so for me it's not just cost of,15:09,A,1,,
5,living which is great it's just a bonus,15:11,A,1,,
5,but for you you might have to live in it,15:13,A,1,,
5,a less expensive place for the time,15:15,A,1,,
5,being and just compromise on that sort,15:17,A,1,,
5,of start at the bottom in terms of cost,15:19,A,1,,
5,of living and work your way up the other,15:21,A,1,,
5,thing that you're definitely going to,15:22,A,1,,
5,need is a stable internet connection,15:24,A,1,,
5,you're going to need,15:25,A,1,,
5,to you know do meetings and calls you're,15:29,A,1,,
5,going to need this also to like,15:30,,,,
5,depending on what kind of job you're,15:32,,,,
5,doing if you're a web developer you're,15:34,,,,
5,going to need to push code to the cloud,15:35,G,1,,
5,and download it if you're a video editor,15:39,G,1,,
5,like me you're going to need some you,15:42,G,1,,
5,know be able to upload and download,15:43,G,1,,
5,video and for the other options it's up,15:46,G,1,,
5,to you basically you can choose to live,15:48,G,1,,
5,in an exotic location a big city a small,15:50,G,1,,
5,city it's really up to you and I know a,15:54,G,1,,
5,few people that always want to work on,15:56,G,1,,
5,an island or from the beach they can do,15:59,G,1,,
5,that I know some people who like the big,16:01,G,1,,
5,city vibe they can do that as well so as,16:04,G,1,,
5,long as it's affordable and it's got,16:05,G,1,,
5,stable internet you can basically you,16:07,G,1,,
5,know choose anywhere so reviewing the,16:09,G,1,,
5,steps step one you've got to build the,16:11,G,1,,
5,skills in order to you know charge,16:14,G,1,,
5,people for your services or build a,16:16,G,1,,
5,business step two you're going to get,16:17,,,,
5,paid for those skills or you're going to,16:20,D,2,,
5,get paid for a service or products,16:22,D,2,,
5,you're providing step three you're going,16:25,D,2,,
5,to eliminate those barriers to freedom,16:26,D,2,,
5,and step four you've got to choose your,16:28,D,2,,
5,locations and I guess step five is just,16:31,D,2,,
5,to do it justice go like that's I didn't,16:33,D,2,,
5,mention that one but you just got at,16:35,D,2,,
5,some point book your flight and and go,16:39,D,2,,
5,and that's a good point to remember is,16:40,D,2,,
5,to if you you know struggling to make,16:43,D,2,,
5,the the jump just booked your flight in,16:45,D,2,,
5,advance because once you've booked that,16:47,D,2,,
5,flight you know you've got a date you've,16:50,D,2,,
5,got a goal and once you get to that date,16:54,D,2,,
5,unless you just give up the flight,16:56,,,,
5,you're going so that's a good way to,16:59,,,,
5,just hold yourself accountable alright,17:01,,,,

5,dedicated to it like I did with this one,18:17,A,3,F,3
6,in 2016 I spent the whole first year of,0:21,A,2,,
6,my Nomad journey based in and around,0:24,,,,
6,Thailand but in 2017 I along with my,0:26,C,1,,
6,girlfriend Denise visited 15 different,0:29,,,,
6,countries across five continents all,0:32,,,,
6,while working remotely and creating,0:34,,,,
6,videos along the way today I'm sharing,0:36,,,,
6,the full story of my most epic year yet,0:39,,,,
6,so the story begins actually right here,0:57,B,1,,
6,in the Gold Coast after our first years,1:00,,,,
6,digital nomads we returned home defeated,1:03,,,,
6,it turned out that one year was just,1:05,,,,
6,enough time for us to get started on,1:08,,,,
6,this journey but we weren't where we,1:10,D,1,,
6,wanted to be yet at this point the,1:11,,,,
6,savings had run out and my position in,1:13,,,,
6,Shanghai had ended so he felt a bit like,1:16,,,,
6,coming back to square one I said this,1:19,,,,
6,time we didn't have the savings and we,1:23,,,,
6,just didn't have the income yet to keep,1:25,,,,
6,going I remember Denise and I went out,1:27,,,,
6,to Surfers Paradise to have a coffee and,1:29,,,,
6,start making plans for the upcoming year,1:32,F,3,,
6,I took out my journal and we wrote down,1:35,,,,
6,some plans and ideas for 2017 and then I,1:38,,,,
6,just brought down these words 2016,1:43,D,2,,
6,survivors nomads 2017 thrive as nomads,1:47,,,,
6,thankfully we didn't have to wait long,1:52,,,,
6,for a new opportunity to come in and,1:54,,,,
6,only nine days into 2017 we were on the,1:56,C,2,,
6,road again,1:59,,,,
6,it took me a while to break out of my,2:02,,,,
6,funk,2:06,C,2,,
6,when we got back to Singapore but at,2:06,,,,
6,some point I just realized you're,2:09,,,,
6,working remotely you have a job now this,2:12,,,,
6,is the dream right I had just scored a,2:16,,,,
6,new freelance client from Sydney that,2:18,F,3,,
6,were giving me regular work and I was,2:20,,,,
6,getting up before dawn each day working,2:22,,,,
6,until around lunchtime and then getting,2:25,D,2,,
6,back into my fitness each afternoon with,2:27,,,,
6,so much temptation around it was a,2:30,,,,
6,little tough to stick to my new diet but,2:32,F,3,,
6,with my new channel Nomad fit I managed,2:35,,,,
6,to keep motivation levels high so I had,2:37,,,,
6,this idea that I wanted to create a,2:43,,,,
6,video on Thailand as a whole for digital,2:45,C,3,,
6,nomads and I looked at Pattaya it had a,2:48,,,,
6,co-working space seemed to have a bit,2:51,,,,
6,going on so I decided to take a stop,2:53,D,3,,
6,over there on the way to Chiang Mai,2:56,,,,
6,by pure coincidence I had time my trip,2:58,,,,
6,in line with an old friend and fellow,3:00,,,,
6,youtuber David bond who showed me his,3:02,,,,
6,new drone and shout out to me on camera,3:05,,,,
6,about being one of the most hated men in,3:07,,,,
6,Asia what they did is they painted me as,3:09,,,,
6,a prayer and I wasn't I don't think of,3:11,,,,
6,myself as a predator but it was during,3:14,,,,
6,an interview with face magazine which is,3:16,,,,
6,a Taiwan or a hong kong magazine the,3:19,,,,
6,inner they interviewed me and I'm like,3:22,,,,
6,no no you understand you know this is,3:23,,,,
6,the truth this is what happened and,3:25,,,,
6,we're not really bad guys and I,3:26,,,,
6,explained and I just explaining,3:28,,,,
6,explaining myself and then when I read,3:30,,,,
6,the article that published all the stuff,3:32,,,,
6,I said wasn't in there after a few days,3:35,,,,
6,hanging with David and checking out some,3:37,,,,
6,of the co-working spaces in the city I,3:39,,,,
6,returned back to our favorite Nomad,3:40,,,,
6,destination Chang,3:42,,,,
6,coming back to Chiang Mai the plan was,3:48,R,2,,
6,just to stay for one month and then go,3:50,,,,
6,somewhere else in Thailand to avoid,3:52,,,,
6,burning season but the place we wanted,3:54,,,,
6,was only available for a minimum of,3:57,,,,
6,three months and so I thought why not,4:00,,,,
6,let's do it,4:03,,,,
6,the next three months became the most,4:04,,,,
6,fruitful and productive period of our,4:06,,,,
6,year abroad I was working 15 to 20 hours,4:08,,,,
6,a week exercising regularly and living,4:11,,,,
6,under my budget creating my biggest,4:15,D,3,,
6,project today living under $600 and once,4:18,,,,
6,I release that video I did not expect,4:22,,,,
6,what was coming next after 45 days on,4:25,,,,
6,YouTube the video went viral generating,4:28,,,,
6,over 70 thousand views in a single day,4:31,,,,
6,before crashing back down,4:33,,,,
6,we were already earning and saving money,4:35,,,,
6,through our freelance clients but the,4:37,F,3,D,2
6,success of living under $600 meant more,4:40,,,,
6,views more subscribers more ad revenue,4:42,,,,
6,and it really just put us ahead for,4:45,,,,
6,March and April it turns out the extra,4:48,,,,
6,money would really help as our next,4:51,,,,
6,destination was one of the most,4:53,,,,
6,expensive in the entire world,4:54,,,,
6,London England the plan was to head to,5:00,,,,
6,Europe in late July but our recent,5:02,A,2,,
6,success encouraged us to fly out for a,5:04,,,,
6,three-week stopover on route to,5:07,,,,
6,Marrakech Morocco sleeping on Denise's,5:09,,,,
6,cousin's couch we tried to keep our cost,5:12,,,,
6,to a minimum while seeing the sights of,5:14,D,2,,
6,London at this point of the journey the,5:16,,,,
6,work had slowed down I had finished all,5:19,,,,
6,the major YouTube projects that I wanted,5:21,,,,
6,to do and my freelance hours were just,5:23,,,,
6,down to a few a week and so with all,5:26,,,,
6,this time and not a huge budget to go,5:30,,,,
6,crazy in London I went back to the only,5:32,,,,
6,thing I knew coding before I even was,5:35,,,,
6,hired as a developer I was always,5:39,C,2,,
6,working on my own projects and I had,5:41,,,,
6,this idea that would undeniably help,5:44,,,,
6,digital nomads with where to go next the,5:47,,,,
6,idea behind the map Wi-Fi was,5:49,,,,
6,essentially a world map of Wi-Fi speeds,5:52,,,,
6,you can choose your destination and then,5:56,,,,
6,dig in to see where the fastest speeds,5:58,A,2,,
6,were in that destination because it have,6:01,,,,
6,been a while since my last app I decided,6:03,,,,
6,to learn a new framework to bring the,6:06,,,,
6,project to life and so I began a long,6:07,,,,
6,journey to learning react and building,6:09,,,,
6,the MVP from the map Wi-Fi,6:12,,,,
6,the Marrakesh experience was a very,6:17,,,,
6,different part of the journey my,6:22,,,,
6,freelance work had slowed down to a,6:24,,,,
6,snail pace and so while everyone else,6:26,,,,
6,was working at the house I was either,6:29,,,,
6,studying react or working on videos for,6:31,,,,
6,my second YouTube channel Chris Dodd,6:35,,,,
6,films our bump in Morocco was a time,6:37,A,2,F,3
6,where a new part of me was led out Chris,6:40,,,,
6,the freelancer turned Chris the video,6:42,,,,
6,creator and I allow myself to branch,6:44,,,,
6,outside the digital nomad niche it's a,6:46,,,,
6,pure travel videography and vlogging the,6:49,,,,
6,time in Morocco was a little bit of a,6:51,,,,
6,transition period to me I had time to,6:53,,,,
6,work on these videos and I also had time,6:57,,,,
6,to study and so I was pursuing these two,7:00,,,,
6,paths studying coding and learning how,7:02,,,,
6,to make these cinematic travel films the,7:06,,,,
6,environment Morocco was conductive to,7:10,,,,
6,capturing beautiful footage but not so,7:12,,,,
6,much for remote work so I decided to run,7:14,,,,
6,with it as the next month I'd be back on,7:17,,,,
6,the digital Nomad trail,7:19,,,,
6,at the time Budapest was rated number,7:34,,,,
6,one on nomads list and so I was excited,7:36,,,,
6,to check it out and figure out if,7:39,,,,
6,Eastern Europe was all that I'd hoped it,7:41,,,,
6,to be for the whole of 2016 we had spent,7:43,,,,
6,our time in Southeast Asia which of,7:46,,,,
6,course is amazing but I always had this,7:49,K,2,,
6,grass is always greener mindset where I,7:52,,,,
6,thought that there might be something,7:56,,,,
6,else out there something better out,7:58,,,,
6,there in Europe and had these high,7:59,,,,
6,expectations that really shouldn't have,8:01,,,,
6,been there,8:04,,,,
6,while Budapest was beautiful I started,8:04,,,,
6,to realize that whatever I was searching,8:07,,,,
6,for in Eastern Europe probably wasn't,8:08,,,,
6,there the idea of Europe was always,8:11,,,,
6,there in the back of our minds a new,8:13,,,,
6,frontier to explore but nothing could,8:15,A,1,D,2
6,really beat the flavour and excitement,8:17,,,,
6,of Southeast Asia,8:19,,,,
6,the next three months became a dark,8:30,,,,
6,period in the journey for me while the,8:33,,,,
6,living was cheap in Eastern Europe my,8:35,,,,
6,excitement and inspiration to create,8:37,,,,
6,videos took a downturn and the creation,8:38,,,,
6,of my new app became long and arduous I,8:41,A,2,,
6,mean don't get me wrong there was some,8:43,,,,
6,distinct highlights from our time in,8:45,,,,
6,Eastern Europe like hanging out with,8:48,,,,
6,Serge in his hometown meeting up with,8:50,N,2,,
6,mitko and Sarah and vana and of course,8:53,,,,
6,my trip to Berlin to meet with my old,8:55,,,,
6,friend is now but overall it felt we,8:58,,,,
6,were just waiting around until our next,9:01,,,,
6,destination thankfully our destination,9:05,,,,
6,after Eastern Europe would be one of the,9:07,,,,
6,most exciting locations we visited in,9:09,,,,
6,the entire Las Palmas de Gran Canaria a,9:11,,,,
6,favorite amongst Europeans seeking,9:19,,,,
6,eternal summer Las Palmas had become one,9:21,,,,
6,of the few places that were actively,9:23,,,,
6,pushing for more digital nomads for us,9:25,,,,
6,it was a relief to find a place we could,9:28,,,,
6,really feel excited to be after more,9:30,,,,
6,than three months hiding out in Eastern,9:32,,,,
6,Europe I signed up at the gym and,9:34,D,2,,
6,started working out of a cool co-working,9:36,,,,
6,space cook co-working see where I was,9:38,,,,
6,able to meet other digital nomads again,9:41,,,,
6,I was happy with my lifestyle but the,9:42,,,,
6,inner conflict continued nomad Wi-Fi was,9:45,,,,
6,now at MVP stage but I wasn't convinced,9:48,,,,
6,about continuing with the project it was,9:51,,,,
6,actually back in Warsaw where my doubts,9:54,,,,
6,towards being a programmer were almost,9:56,,,,
6,at a tipping point I remember sitting,9:59,,,,
6,down with this developer at Google,10:01,,,,
6,campus and he just spent an hour talking,10:04,,,,
6,to me about all this programming stuff,10:08,,,,
6,and I've just went over the head that,10:09,,,,
6,meeting in Warsaw allowed an,10:13,S,3,,
6,uncomfortable truth to surface and in,10:15,,,,
6,Las Palmas de Gran Canaria I decided to,10:17,,,,
6,stop resisting it for the last six,10:20,,,,
6,months I've been pushing for something,10:22,,,,
6,that wasn't really right for me but,10:23,,,,
6,without a plan for what would take its,10:26,,,,
6,place I just continued grinding,10:29,,,,
6,being a remote developer was always the,10:40,,,,
6,plan from the moment we left Australia,10:44,A,3,,
6,to become nomads that was the plan I,10:45,,,,
6,would be a remote developer but to be,10:48,,,,
6,entirely honest after the two-week,10:52,,,,
6,period where my contract had ended with,10:54,,,,
6,my previous employer I had something,10:57,,,,
6,else calling me and in Gran Canaria I,11:00,,,,
6,decided to let go and just accept it in,11:03,,,,
6,Gran Canaria I would finish what was,11:06,A,2,,
6,probably the most influential book of my,11:09,,,,
6,life to date the code of the,11:11,,,,
6,extraordinary mind there's a section in,11:13,,,,
6,the book about inspiration and actually,11:15,,,,
6,there's a few really powerful quotes in,11:18,,,,
6,the book I encourage you to read it but,11:19,,,,
6,the idea of the chapter in essence is,11:22,,,,
6,that your inspiration is calling you and,11:25,,,,
6,it's your choice whether to answer it,11:28,,,,
6,actually there's a quotes by Steve Jobs,11:31,,,,
6,in there that really ties it off and,11:35,,,,
6,I'll read it for you guys now have the,11:37,,,,
6,courage to follow your heart and,11:40,,,,
6,intuition they somehow already know what,11:41,,,,
6,you truly want to become everything else,11:44,,,,
6,is secondary what did this mean for me,11:47,C,3,,
6,it meant number one stop beating myself,11:50,,,,
6,up about following my inspiration and,11:52,,,,
6,number two stop forcing myself to be a,11:55,,,,
6,developer this breakthrough to follow my,11:58,,,,
6,inspiration would come at the perfect,12:00,,,,
6,time as I was just about to start 21,12:02,,,,
6,days of continuous filming for two of,12:04,,,,
6,the biggest events in the digital Nomad,12:06,,,,
6,calendar,12:09,,,,
6,after Nomad cruise we spent two nights,12:40,,,,
6,in Panama City before heading down to,12:42,,,,
6,manage in completing the edits of the,12:45,,,,
6,two event videos would keep me busy for,12:47,K,1,,
6,the time being that and exploring the,12:49,,,,
6,many sites of metazine,12:52,,,,
6,Denise and I had planned to go down to,12:53,,,,
6,Medici in long before we even got on the,12:56,,,,
6,Nomad cruise but luckily enough there,12:59,,,,
6,was a bunch of people from the cruise,13:02,,,,
6,that wanted to come down and so we had a,13:04,,,,
6,great time hanging out with friends we,13:07,,,,
6,just made from the cruise in one of the,13:09,,,,
6,most exciting cities in the world giving,13:11,,,,
6,myself permission to create without,13:14,,,,
6,restriction my youtube channel blog and,13:15,,,,
6,podcast became a full-time project as we,13:18,,,,
6,headed into our next destination,13:21,,,,
6,my time in Playa del Carmen was one of,13:27,,,,
6,the busiest for me of the year in terms,13:29,,,,
6,of content creation after I'd left,13:31,,,,
6,Chiang Mai and finished the Nomad city,13:33,L,2,,
6,and Nomad cruise videos this was the,13:36,,,,
6,busiest time for me in terms of creating,13:39,,,,
6,content at nest co-working space I found,13:42,,,,
6,a great place to work but also an,13:45,,,,
6,opportunity to create a bunch of,13:47,,,,
6,spin-off videos promoting local,13:49,,,,
6,businesses in Playa del Carmen through,13:50,,,,
6,its founder Nathaniel I released new,13:52,,,,
6,blog posts new podcast episodes and made,13:55,,,,
6,a start on a new book that would be,13:58,,,,
6,released later in the year,14:00,,,,
6,Playa del Carmen was basically the last,14:04,,,,
6,place we wanted to check out as like a,14:07,,,,
6,digital Nomad destination but on the way,14:09,L,2,,
6,home we decided to pass through the USA,14:13,,,,
6,as opportunities have opened up to Co,14:15,,,,
6,live and outside Brooklyn and outside,14:18,,,,
6,Venice Beach in between New York and LA,14:21,,,,
6,we spent 10 days in Vegas where I locked,14:24,,,,
6,myself at home for five days to really,14:26,,,,
6,get stuck into writing my new book on,14:29,,,,
6,the weekends we'd spend time in new and,14:31,,,,
6,old friends on the strip before heading,14:33,,,,
6,to our final destination Los Angeles,14:35,,,,
6,finishing our Nomad journey for 2017 in,14:41,,,,
6,Los Angeles felt a little bit like,14:45,,,,
6,coming full circle I consider my study,14:47,,,,
6,abroad experience in LA to be kind of,14:51,,,,
6,the prelude from my Nomad journey,14:53,,,,
6,because it was my first experience,14:55,,,,
6,living abroad and my first experience,14:57,,,,
6,traveling solo it was here in LA that I,15:00,,,,
6,caught the travel bug all those years,15:02,,,,
6,ago and now at the end of 2017 it would,15:04,,,,
6,be where we cap off the end of our two,15:07,,,,
6,year world travel journey 2017 has,15:10,,,,
6,taught me so many things but perhaps the,15:15,,,,
6,biggest lesson is that the dream is not,15:17,,,,
6,necessarily about being a digital nomad,15:20,,,,
6,the dream is freedom the freedom to,15:22,,,,
6,travel the freedom to work remotely the,15:25,,,,
6,freedom to work on what inspires you,15:28,,,,
6,most it's freedom that is the most,15:29,,,,
6,important lesson and in 2017 I've been,15:32,,,,
6,around the world to discover that,15:35,,,,
6,whether you're nomads or a settler it's,15:36,K,1,,
6,the freedom of choice that defines,15:38,,,,
6,new rich you know I've been so obsessed,15:40,,,,
6,with this digital nomad idea that I,15:42,,,,
6,continue to travel on and on even when I,15:44,,,,
6,wasn't necessarily excited about that,15:48,,,,
6,next destination and now don't get me,15:50,,,,
6,traveling to fifteen destinations across,15:53,,,,
6,wrong,15:53,,,,
6,five continents in a space of a year of,15:55,,,,
6,course was a rewarding experience but,15:58,K,2,L,3
6,for me it's not so much the quantity of,16:00,,,,
6,destinations now as it is the quality,16:04,,,,
6,and now leaving into 2018 location,16:06,,,,
6,independence to me means being able to,16:10,,,,
6,live and work wherever you want wherever,16:12,,,,
6,it's from the beach in Thailand or from,16:14,,,,
6,your home and let's say Midwest USA it,16:16,,,,
6,really is the choice that matters of,16:20,,,,
6,course this whole journey could not be,16:25,,,,
6,possible without the support of you guys,16:27,,,,
6,and I want to thank you all for coming,16:29,,,,
6,along this ride is not the end of Krista,16:31,,,,
6,freelancer but a new beginning and I'll,16:34,,,,
6,be in touch soon about where we go from,16:36,,,,
6,here,16:38,,,,
6,say motivated stay subscribed and I'll,16:39,,,,
6,see you on the next video,16:42,,,,
6,you,17:03,,,,
7,so we're truly living in very,0:01,L,1,,
7,interesting times luckily we have the,0:03,,,,
7,Internet to keep us connected and sane,0:05,,,,
7,and I also feel lucky there's all my,0:07,,,,
7,friends all over the world so I'm just,0:09,,,,
7,gonna call them right now,0:10,,,,
7,and ask them the perspective with all,0:12,P,1,,
7,these copies situation because,0:14,,,,
7,everyone's going through it in very,0:16,,,,
7,different ways so let's see what we can,0:18,,,,
7,learn from each one well how are you,0:31,,,,
7,doing good good I mean Toledo Ohio where,0:34,,,,
7,are you live here in Tokyo on the Gold,0:36,,,,
7,Coast in Australia I'm in playa de,0:40,A,1,,
7,carmen in Mexico area magazine Colombia,0:44,,,,
7,in Lithuania I'm in Ottawa at the moment,0:46,,,,
7,I mean I'm Stefan right now nobody got,0:48,,,,
7,my Sri Lanka I'm here in Bali a lot of,0:51,,,,
7,us nomads we had to make that big,0:53,,,,
7,decision do we stay or do we go the,0:55,,,,
7,general thought back then was that it,0:57,,,,
7,would be much safer to go to a home,0:59,,,,
7,country or western world country that,1:01,P,2,A,2
7,stay in a developing country like,1:03,,,,
7,Indonesia I ended up cutting my trip,1:05,,,,
7,short was in Nicaragua I just wanted to,1:08,,,,
7,see what it felt better and my mom who,1:09,,,,
7,would have felt a lot better knowing,1:11,,,,
7,that I was because I think when,1:14,,,,
7,something like this happens you don't,1:16,,,,
7,want to be in a place where you don't,1:17,,,,
7,speak the language where you don't know,1:19,A,2,D,2
7,what's going on so for me what's really,1:21,,,,
7,important to just go home and find a new,1:24,,,,
7,way to work here we got back here it's,1:27,,,,
7,Mehdi and then a week later at Columbia,1:30,,,,
7,got their first confirmed case and,1:32,,,,
7,started to shut down and then everything,1:35,,,,
7,changed,1:36,,,,
7,that's crazy right so how is the,1:38,,,,
7,situation in your CD there are some,1:40,,,,
7,lockdown laws but not as tight as other,1:43,,,,
7,places I'm near the beach here which you,1:47,,,,
7,can still go to the beach but you can't,1:49,,,,
7,sit on the beach I think they're doing a,1:52,D,1,,
7,reasonably good job in in addressing the,1:57,,,,
7,situation and there's a lot of,1:59,,,,
7,grassroots efforts as well about like,2:01,,,,
7,making masks and educating the public,2:04,,,,
7,are pleasantly surprised about how this,2:07,,,,
7,is all playing out so far very well,2:09,,,,
7,organized was like bigger restaurants,2:12,,,,
7,closing first,2:13,G,2,C,2
7,some places open until now there is like,2:16,,,,
7,some smaller restaurants are open but,2:18,,,,
7,you can just take take away but is like,2:20,,,,
7,you still have service is everything is,2:22,,,,
7,quiet it's just like it's a little bit,2:24,,,,
7,goes down but there also I kind of like,2:26,,,,
7,it you have to use the last number of,2:28,,,,
7,your idea and you can only go out on,2:31,,,,
7,certain days this week my days were,2:34,,,,
7,Monday and Saturday Rachel's were,2:35,,,,
7,Thursday and Sunday and now they're,2:38,,,,
7,imposing really big fines on anyone,2:40,,,,
7,who's out on a day that's not there's,2:42,,,,
7,nine hundred thousand faces and even two,2:45,,,,
7,hundred twenty twenty thirty dollars,2:46,,,,
7,it's a lot of money I don't know the,2:48,,,,
7,news is not sounding good for us right,2:50,,,,
7,now,2:50,,,,
7,like there's a lot of new cases every,2:52,,,,
7,day but we're all allowed to go outside,2:54,,,,
7,we've never been in lockdown here this,3:01,J,1,A,2
7,time around they were like super careful,3:03,,,,
7,from the start,3:06,,,,
7,last week and two days,3:07,,,,
7,where they announced zero negations,3:09,,,,
7,which is crazy the streets are a ghost,3:12,,,,
7,town except on beautiful days like today,3:14,,,,
7,they've actually closed off the roads to,3:16,,,,
7,cards because there's so many people,3:18,,,,
7,beautiful,3:20,,,,
7,that will try to get outside when it's,3:20,S,1,C,2
7,like session on the weekend so we're,3:23,,,,
7,keeping social distance but able to walk,3:25,,,,
7,around a bit the being in the Coulee,3:27,,,,
7,being we have a social life actually too,3:30,,,,
7,much of a social life because,3:31,,,,
7,everybody's stuck in here so we actually,3:33,,,,
7,had more than in real life where,3:37,,,,
7,everybody does their stuff outside the,3:39,,,,
7,quarantine started really early here it,3:42,,,,
7,started mid-march and it was 24-hour,3:45,,,,
7,seven-day-a-week quarantine it's almost,3:47,,,,
7,like being on castaway but I have food I,3:51,,,,
7,have water I have shelter and had the,3:54,D,2,,
7,Internet yeah we had the thing Dane,3:55,,,,
7,Turner right which makes me wonder has,3:57,,,,
7,Coby it affecting your work well I do,3:59,,,,
7,create or try to create a lot of travel,4:03,,,,
7,content can't do that right now but,4:05,,,,
7,luckily I can still create content and,4:07,,,,
7,still freelance as a web developer even,4:10,,,,
7,while stuck in the one place we have,4:13,,,,
7,also been like quite busy teaching,4:16,F,3,,
7,English online because our students are,4:18,,,,
7,in China and they've been home per month,4:20,,,,
7,but since the kids have been home we've,4:22,,,,
7,just been working morning night morning,4:23,,,,
7,night more than night morning,4:25,,,,
7,I used to have three jobs here and I'm,4:27,,,,
7,now working in a way for all three of,4:29,,,,
7,them again like even the third company,4:31,,,,
7,like they hired me a couple weeks ago to,4:33,,,,
7,do more proofreading for them so it's,4:36,,,,
7,all remote but it's like it's just cut,4:39,,,,
7,it's not so much money but it's covering,4:40,,,,
7,you know it's good to have that's what,4:43,,,,
7,I've learned in this crisis is like,4:44,,,,
7,you've got to have your finger and a lot,4:46,,,,
7,of pies yeah yeah because we ran your,4:53,,,,
7,what's called the urban core living or,4:55,A,3,,
7,we don't take people we would we don't,4:57,,,,
7,know because we need to trust each other,4:59,,,,
7,so we don't anyone from outside when we,5:01,,,,
7,go out we nee wear masks when we come in,5:04,,,,
7,we wash our hands we wash ourselves we,5:07,,,,
7,wash our persons do we do a little bit,5:09,,,,
7,more than someone who lives in a regular,5:11,,,,
7,house because we're a bunch of people,5:13,,,,
7,together ever and now going you know for,5:16,,,,
7,the future I'm scared to put down a ten,5:18,,,,
7,thousand dollar non-refundable deposit I,5:21,,,,
7,don't want to you know ever go to the,5:24,,,,
7,ticket holders and say like look I'm,5:25,,,,
7,sorry you know like I can be funded,5:27,S,2,,
7,because it's their not their fault I,5:28,,,,
7,want to be able to take care of them but,5:30,,,,
7,I think a lot people don't think about,5:31,,,,
7,that and all that people will think like,5:33,,,,
7,oh you know I I put down my deposit I,5:35,,,,
7,want my money back where I bought the,5:36,,,,
7,ticket I want my money back,5:37,,,,
7,it's a hard situation like for everyone,5:40,,,,
7,so here's the thing if our main thing,5:43,,,,
7,was having events and we started getting,5:45,,,,
7,more into having socially conscious,5:47,,,,
7,trips so people can connect more with,5:50,,,,
7,locals and and and had opportunities to,5:53,,,,
7,get back to them all that just stopped I,5:55,,,,
7,mean you can't social distance and bring,5:57,,,,
7,people together it's then it's a,5:59,,,,
7,mutually exclusive however we're doing,6:02,,,,
7,what so many amazing people are doing is,6:04,,,,
7,we're bringing things online because I,6:06,,,,
7,run like an SEO agency it's completely,6:09,,,,
7,remote remote businesses that can't,6:12,A,2,,
7,network offline or you know have those,6:15,,,,
7,sort of disappears offline they're,6:16,,,,
7,turning to online agencies so it's a,6:18,,,,
7,pretty good time too the company I work,6:21,,,,
7,with it's a very highly connected it's a,6:24,,,,
7,it's in health care Fiat and no work for,6:28,,,,
7,safe doings and we are all working in,6:30,,,,
7,crazy a lot but,6:33,,,,
7,it's it's very needed right now and we,6:35,,,,
7,know that actually with every step we,6:39,,,,
7,take we can actually help people so,6:41,,,,
7,lockdown community it's been it's been,6:44,,,,
7,very different it's been different to,6:45,,,,
7,most people as I have a permit to go out,6:48,C,3,,
7,from shoot I was very lucky I've been,6:49,,,,
7,able to sell my footage to some big news,6:52,,,,
7,agencies Sky News I'm doing it because I,6:55,,,,
7,wonder and that's why I started that,6:57,,,,
7,campaign as well raising Hope which is,6:59,,,,
7,"raised nearly 15,000 dollars I think",7:03,,,,
7,and how to productivity over these days,7:06,,,,
7,there there are really good days but you,7:09,,,,
7,know like you think oh I'm I'm back to,7:11,,,,
7,my normal and then you know like you,7:13,,,,
7,wake up and nurse basically you have,7:15,,,,
7,zero motivation to do anything and I,7:17,,,,
7,just get bored and I want to do,7:18,,,,
7,something productive and I want to do,7:20,,,,
7,something that would that would help me,7:23,,,,
7,after this this or this is all over and,7:27,A,3,,
7,it's yeah they're just bad days of life,7:31,,,,
7,it just goes up not another I don't read,7:34,,,,
7,the news now anymore,7:35,,,,
7,maybe only once a week to catch up but I,7:38,,,,
7,try not to get all these negative,7:41,,,,
7,effects and just focus on my work the,7:44,,,,
7,best thing we can do is to stay,7:46,,,,
7,productive stay you know to do yoga to,7:50,,,,
7,meditate to do handstands keep our,7:52,,,,
7,immune system up by exercising and and,7:57,,,,
7,not eating or consuming all this junk,7:58,,,,
7,food and not just sitting around,8:00,,,,
7,I've been keeping myself busy I mean to,8:03,,,,
7,be honest this is this is a pretty,8:06,,,,
7,standard day I think for a nomad - like,8:10,,,,
7,going out and scoring but like I usually,8:13,,,,
7,work the majority of my day at home on a,8:16,,,,
7,computer sitting down by myself I think,8:19,,,,
7,the hardest part of this is being at the,8:22,,,,
7,computer all day and then the things we,8:24,,,,
7,would normally do when you just connect,8:26,,,,
7,the adventures the fun we excitement we,8:28,,,,
7,can't do it anymore and like I want to,8:32,,,,
7,connect socially with people but the,8:33,,,,
7,last thing I feel like doing at the end,8:35,M,1,,
7,of the day after spitting at my laptop,8:36,,,,
7,is sitting at my laptop on a video call,8:39,,,,
7,even though I want to talk to people do,8:42,,,,
7,you remember those times when you do,8:48,,,,
7,tell me what do you think it will change,8:51,,,,
7,for digital nomads after the pandemic,8:57,,,,
7,yeah they're not gonna look those are,8:59,,,,
7,the crazy guys anymore yeah exactly,9:02,,,,
7,give me like a similar percentage of,9:05,,,,
7,increase I think on nomads because it'll,9:08,,,,
7,just make sense economically financially,9:11,,,,
7,people might be looking for more meaning,9:13,M,1,,
7,in their lives and want to like learn,9:16,,,,
7,skills and just expose themselves to new,9:18,,,,
7,languages and new opportunities so all,9:20,,,,
7,the reasons that I love being a nomad I,9:22,,,,
7,think other people are gonna catch on,9:23,,,,
7,now that they're empowered before it,9:26,,,,
7,wasn't necessarily a choice,9:28,,,,
7,now it can be a choice you know that's,9:30,,,,
7,true we nomads they're going to be doing,9:33,,,,
7,more more spontaneous traveling instead,9:36,,,,
7,of planning and saying I'm gonna spend,9:38,,,,
7,you know like three three months in,9:40,,,,
7,Mexico three months in Europe three,9:42,,,,
7,months in India I think they're just,9:44,,,,
7,gonna be thinking more short-term than,9:46,,,,
7,long-term people have been asking me you,9:50,,,,
7,know where you're gonna travel to first,9:52,,,,
7,after the lockdown ends as if a lockdown,9:56,,,,
7,ending is one point in time but you know,10:00,,,,
7,every country is dealing with it,10:01,,,,
7,differently I don't think the free,10:04,,,,
7,travel where you can just show up you,10:06,,,,
7,know for no reason other than tourism,10:08,,,,
7,it's gonna happen anytime soon,10:10,F,3,,
7,like if I was willing to bet I think,10:14,,,,
7,unrestricted travel is gonna be closer,10:16,,,,
7,to the end of the summer at the earliest,10:20,,,,
7,and latest it's gonna be like you know,10:24,,,,
7,Christmas or later but who knows well I,10:28,,,,
7,think something there will be more,10:30,,,,
7,regulations in place whether they come,10:32,,,,
7,out with a nomad visa or they put in,10:34,,,,
7,greater restrictions I think it's gonna,10:35,,,,
7,go either way for more and more,10:37,,,,
7,countries as opposed to just not,10:39,,,,
7,acknowledging out like I've been telling,10:41,,,,
7,myself to and I'll get on a plane but I,10:44,,,,
7,know that's not gonna happen so I mean,10:47,,,,
7,basically 2020 it has been cancelled,10:49,F,3,,
7,regarding travel,10:54,,,,
7,yeah we're gonna look back on back at,10:57,,,,
7,this in a year's time and we're gonna be,11:00,,,,
7,like wow and there you have it I hope,11:04,,,,
7,these conversations give you a better,11:05,,,,
7,insight of our lifestyle and I gotta,11:08,,,,
7,thank all the normal school at that time,11:09,,,,
7,to talk with me I'm gonna put the Lisa,11:11,,,,
7,everyone here and these calls were made,11:14,,,,
7,in a web app called we're vine is from,11:16,,,,
7,by nomads and I like it because browser,11:18,O,2,A,1
7,base is very easy to use but I'm sorry,11:20,,,,
7,sometimes this sound wasn't the best,11:22,,,,
7,like they have a few things to improve,11:24,,,,
7,and yeah just gonna say that we're all,11:26,,,,
7,in this together and I don't know in a,11:28,,,,
7,couple of years we're gonna read this in,11:30,,,,
7,history books or something we're just,11:32,,,,
7,gonna laugh about it so right now we,11:33,,,,
7,just gotta stay strong stay connected,11:35,,,,
7,and stay safe so I hope you like this,11:38,,,,
7,video and see you the next one ciao,11:40,,,,
8,hey folks it's Eric can tell from,0:02,A,1,G,2

8,whatever it's gonna happen after that,0:12,,,,

8,the beach and stuff like ride a,0:25,,,,
8,motorbike around that a lot of people,0:27,,,,
8,don't have these days so we're pretty,0:29,F,3,,
8,happy about it and now you're somebody,0:32,,,,
8,who I would say is the most of the most,0:36,,,,
8,in touch with the digital nomad,0:38,,,,
8,lifestyle can you explain a bit about,0:40,,,,
8,your history and your connections within,0:42,,,,
8,the sort of scene yeah for sure so I've,0:45,,,,
8,been a digital nomad for over three,0:46,,,,
8,years now and I just like to spend half,0:49,,,,
8,my year in places that don't have a big,0:51,,,,
8,digital nomad scene and trying to build,0:53,A,2,,
8,them up or you know taking advantage of,0:56,,,,
8,those kind of quiet places like delegate,0:59,,,,
8,for example and I spent half my year in,1:01,,,,
8,big digital nomad hubs where I connect,1:03,,,,
8,with a lot of digital nomads I sometimes,1:05,,,,
8,put on events or go to events like,1:07,,,,
8,Chiang Mai's a good example and I'm very,1:10,,,,
8,active with the conference scene as well,1:12,G,2,A,2
8,I go to the Nomad summit every year and,1:14,,,,
8,a whole bunch of online platforms where,1:16,,,,
8,which connects nomads together so I I do,1:19,,,,
8,love the digital Nomad scene and I would,1:21,,,,
8,define myself as a digital Nomad as well,1:23,,,,
8,yeah me too actually but I've done it by,1:27,,,,
8,building this business support a venture,1:28,,,,
8,that gives people sort of full time ish,1:32,,,,
8,work that they can work from wherever,1:34,,,,
8,they like you usually chain to a,1:36,,,,
8,different time zone but even that is,1:37,,,,
8,negotiable and I built this sort of,1:42,,,,
8,lifestyle based on building this company,1:44,C,1,,
8,which takes me to some of the digital,1:46,,,,
8,Nomad hotspots which we find as,1:48,,,,
8,extremely agreeable for training new,1:51,,,,
8,people and finding new people to join,1:53,,,,
8,our company like the Medici in Colombia,1:56,,,,
8,like the Chiang Mai Thai lines lengthe,1:58,,,,
8,well they'll get Soviet it's a it's a,2:00,,,,
8,good place to set up well first is we'll,2:02,A,2,C,2
8,know medicine everyone who goes there,2:04,,,,
8,finds it as such but it's not,2:07,,,,
8,on the hotspot of maps like other cities,2:10,,,,
8,Lisp in Turkey ever yeah in Europe yeah,2:14,,,,
8,so what did the lifestyle look like,2:17,,,,
8,before this there are all sorts of,2:19,,,,
8,different people with all sorts of,2:20,,,,
8,different sort of ways of earning their,2:23,,,,
8,income traveling from place to place,2:25,,,,
8,whenever they like so how is that,2:27,,,,
8,changing now what do you think well I,2:29,,,,
8,mean one of the big freedoms that,2:31,,,,
8,defines the digital nomad community is,2:33,,,,
8,the location independence which means,2:35,,,,
8,that you can hop on a flight anywhere,2:37,,,,
8,that your passport allows you to and of,2:39,,,,
8,course now borders are shut so the very,2:42,,,,
8,concept of digital nomads relies very,2:44,,,,
8,heavily on the you know open borders and,2:47,,,,
8,ability to travel so right now all the,2:50,,,,
8,digital nomads all there in the world,2:51,J,1,A,2
8,are stuck wherever they are and for some,2:53,,,,
8,people it's not so bad like for us here,2:55,,,,
8,in in Thailand it's better than you saw,2:58,,,,
8,this one coming yeah if I would be in,3:00,,,,
8,Canada or where I oh where I am from,3:02,,,,
8,or if Eric would be in Belgrade where he,3:05,,,,
8,usually lives you know both the story of,3:08,,,,
8,much higher cases Belarus lockdown we,3:11,,,,
8,would be more defined by the ability to,3:13,,,,
8,just carry on business as usual working,3:16,S,1,C,2
8,from home and we would be but the,3:20,,,,
8,flexibility that versus the flexibility,3:22,,,,
8,of being able to rent an Airbnb in,3:24,,,,
8,another country fly there over a weekend,3:26,,,,
8,and be there for Monday morning business,3:29,,,,
8,as usual so that's changed a lot but,3:32,,,,
8,that's only temporary what I wanted to,3:33,,,,
8,talk about with this video is where is,3:36,,,,
8,it going I think it's gonna be,3:39,,,,
8,interesting to see how it evolves in,3:41,,,,
8,definitely if the virus epidemic,3:45,,,,
8,progresses in such a way that you can't,3:48,,,,
8,travel without having 14 days,3:50,D,2,,
8,quarantined in a certain place where,3:52,,,,
8,you're arriving or something like that,3:54,,,,
8,we're gonna see a lot more slow mads,3:57,,,,
8,meaning people who will book their cell,4:00,,,,
8,for a place knowing that as it's a hit,4:02,,,,
8,they're gonna enjoy it based on what,4:04,,,,
8,they've read or how they've traveled,4:06,,,,
8,before and they're gonna be spending you,4:08,,,,
8,know something like three months in,4:11,F,3,,
8,those places and really getting a lot,4:13,,,,
8,more lifestyle normality and,4:15,,,,
8,acclimation to the surroundings that,4:18,,,,
8,they tend to find themselves in so how,4:22,,,,
8,would you adapt to that what would where,4:24,,,,
8,would your top places to spend three,4:26,,,,
8,months be a part from Belgrade which I,4:28,,,,
8,know I'll tell them why you like those,4:29,,,,
8,good yes so my top three places I'd say,4:31,,,,
8,in Europe I would love to be an either,4:33,,,,
8,Belgrade or Kiev or Lisbon in Asia I,4:37,,,,
8,would like to be in Chiang Mai or I like,4:42,,,,
8,Malaysia quite a bit as well I could see,4:44,,,,
8,myself spending time in Bali although I,4:46,,,,
8,haven't been there um I think you know,4:49,,,,
8,to touch upon a points of how digital,4:52,,,,
8,nomads will be different after the whole,4:54,A,3,,
8,coronavirus thing I think a big factor,4:56,,,,
8,will be the price of travel so right now,4:58,,,,
8,we know that a lot of airlines are,5:00,,,,
8,completely shut down yeah when they,5:02,,,,
8,start up again we don't know exactly how,5:05,,,,
8,much demand we're gonna see in the,5:06,,,,
8,travel industry but they're gonna charge,5:08,,,,
8,more for a ticket or they're gonna go,5:10,,,,
8,bargain basement prices to get just if,5:12,,,,
8,people in those planes I think,5:14,,,,
8,realistically we're gonna expect higher,5:15,,,,
8,prices because we don't have the,5:17,,,,
8,economies of scale kicking in and a lot,5:18,,,,
8,of these come you know airlines are,5:20,S,2,,
8,going to be in very very dire they've,5:23,,,,
8,already laid out their stuff yeah so I,5:25,,,,
8,don't know that's a big factor I think,5:29,,,,
8,that with the whole slow travel it's not,5:32,,,,
8,slow nomads thing it's something we've,5:33,,,,
8,been seeing more and more in the digital,5:35,,,,
8,moment community natural tendency of,5:37,,,,
8,people wanting more routine wanting more,5:40,,,,
8,stability,5:41,,,,
8,yeah even even if you take the whole you,5:44,,,,
8,know virus epidemic out of the picture,5:46,,,,
8,it seemed to be a trend that I've been,5:47,,,,
8,seeing more and more of people spending,5:49,,,,
8,you know at least three months in a,5:51,,,,
8,place slow travel as they call it yeah I,5:53,,,,
8,think now people will be forced to do,5:55,,,,
8,that and some people might like that,5:57,,,,
8,other people might you know as soon as,5:59,,,,
8,they're able to travel again go on a big,6:01,,,,
8,travel spree to kind of you know feel,6:04,,,,
8,free again yeah but for sure there's,6:06,A,2,,
8,gonna be more slow travelers up so there,6:08,,,,
8,will probably be a lot more,6:09,,,,
8,organisations in spaces set up to,6:11,,,,
8,accommodate these people 100% even if,6:14,,,,
8,you look at the you know outside of the,6:16,,,,
8,digital nomad space the big cities in,6:18,,,,
8,let's say North America and Europe many,6:21,,,,
8,many people are now forced to work,6:23,,,,
8,remotely and those people might want to,6:26,,,,
8,continue to work remotely after,6:28,,,,
8,epidemic is over I'd go to places where,6:29,,,,
8,they can cut their costs yeah and and,6:31,,,,
8,companies might realize you know why are,6:33,,,,
8,we keeping our office why are we paying,6:35,C,3,,
8,five thousand euros a month for this if,6:36,,,,
8,we know that our staff can produce good,6:39,,,,
8,work without it so I think we're gonna,6:41,,,,
8,see a big push with co-working spaces,6:44,,,,
8,with coal living spaces and with,6:46,,,,
8,companies that are more relaxed in their,6:49,,,,
8,remote working policy and why not give,6:52,,,,
8,these expats or people you know who are,6:54,,,,
8,only from more affordable places why not,6:57,,,,
8,give them more of a chance because,6:59,,,,
8,companies have already been forced to,7:01,,,,
8,adapt their culture to work remotely,7:03,,,,
8,yeah I think that's gonna be more of a,7:05,,,,
8,medium to long term change I don't think,7:07,,,,
8,we're gonna start seeing that,7:08,,,,
8,immediately but I think this is a big,7:10,A,3,,
8,push to kind of make that a reality yeah,7:12,,,,
8,and the reality tends to look like it's,7:16,,,,
8,gonna be more except accepted what we're,7:18,,,,
8,doing it's gonna be more mainstream,7:19,,,,
8,isn't it yeah it's going to be more on,7:24,,,,
8,the radar of common people who are,7:25,,,,
8,thinking about what to do with their,7:26,,,,
8,lives if they know that they could go,7:28,,,,
8,somewhere and so we're gonna see lots of,7:31,,,,
8,people who are just like willing to give,7:34,,,,
8,this lifestyle a try because their their,7:36,,,,
8,life has already been disrupted by this,7:38,,,,
8,whole situation yeah yeah I think this,7:43,,,,
8,is definitely going to be a big push,7:45,,,,
8,towards digital no medicine for people,7:47,,,,
8,that haven't even considered it before,7:48,,,,
8,you know now they suddenly have a remote,7:50,,,,
8,job if it stays remote after this whole,7:53,,,,
8,epidemic is over,7:54,,,,
8,why not go to Mexico for the weekend and,7:57,,,,
8,or winter yeah and then realize you can,7:59,,,,
8,stay there and you know there's good,8:01,,,,
8,infrastructure and then you'll go back,8:02,,,,
8,there the second time for longer and,8:03,,,,
8,then you know that's just going to be a,8:05,J,2,,
8,seed that's gonna be a start of,8:07,,,,
8,something so in 10 or 15 years we might,8:09,,,,
8,see or know even like in five years we,8:12,,,,
8,might see a wave of people that have,8:14,,,,
8,become a digital Nomad from the seeds,8:15,,,,
8,planted through this epidemic of staying,8:18,,,,
8,at home of being able to work remotely,8:21,,,,
8,and of continuing that trend after the,8:23,,,,
8,and yeah definitely more people working,8:26,,,,
8,real jobs you know less people chasing,8:28,,,,
8,this 4-hour workweek thing you know yeah,8:32,,,,
8,because I mean it might be there might,8:34,A,2,,
8,be an uptick on or,8:35,,,,
8,time work that will pay you enough to be,8:37,,,,
8,somewhere like Mexico and people making,8:39,,,,
8,a lifestyle decision hey I'd rather work,8:41,,,,
8,from home from Mexico and work less,8:44,,,,
8,hours then you know stay where I'm at,8:47,,,,
8,and continue working in the right race,8:50,,,,
8,and barely having enough to get by but,8:53,,,,
8,yeah these people who are running little,8:56,,,,
8,online businesses and stuff like that I,8:58,,,,
8,guess they'll still be around they'll,9:00,,,,
8,still be around but really the the,9:03,,,,
8,full-time worker will become the norm,9:06,,,,
8,I think whereas previously really was,9:08,,,,
8,the producer on the lines well I think,9:09,,,,
8,that I think we're still gonna see the,9:11,,,,
8,entrepreneurs and the people that are,9:13,,,,
8,running their own businesses remotely,9:14,,,,
8,but they make a much smaller percentage,9:16,,,,
8,of the population in comparison to just,9:18,,,,
8,normal workers and I think as it becomes,9:22,,,,
8,more normal for jobs to say yeah you can,9:24,,,,
8,go work from Mexico you can go work from,9:27,,,,
8,Colombia you can go and work from Serbia,9:30,F,3,,
8,yeah I'm going work from Vietnam is that,9:33,,,,
8,becomes more accepted I think that all,9:35,,,,
8,of these people who are selling the,9:36,,,,
8,dream of digital nomads you know these,9:38,,,,
8,people that so webinars that teach,9:41,,,,
8,people how to sell webinars on how to,9:43,,,,
8,become a digital nomad and that's their,9:45,,,,
8,main source of income you'll see less of,9:46,,,,
8,those people because it will just be,9:47,,,,
8,like duh yeah I was just gonna apply for,9:50,,,,
8,a road job and go move this place and,9:52,,,,
8,then I'll be a digital nomad the whole,9:54,,,,
8,mystique of the lifestyle will be will,9:57,,,,
8,be reduced ugly because you'll become,10:01,,,,
8,just so much more common and the whole,10:04,F,3,,
8,like flexing of people posting pictures,10:08,,,,
8,itself some great place it'll just,10:09,,,,
8,become so much more comment and with,10:11,,,,
8,that there will be a lot more demand for,10:14,,,,
8,places and places to rent and there will,10:17,,,,
8,be a lot more change to neighborhoods as,10:19,,,,
8,well in these lower cost places that,10:21,,,,
8,people perceive as desirable or exotic,10:24,,,,
8,don't you think yeah and it's it's,10:27,,,,
8,something I'm afraid of so right now I,10:29,,,,
8,love being a digital nomad because it's,10:31,Q,2,A,1
8,a ability to immerse myself in a new,10:33,,,,
8,culture and oftentimes I like to,10:35,,,,
8,surround myself with the locals and you,10:37,,,,
8,know learn about that culture as opposed,10:39,,,,
8,to just be with other Western expats and,10:42,,,,
8,nomads but what I'm afraid of is that if,10:45,,,,
8,you look at what happened to the world,10:47,,,,
8,before the epidemic with China,10:48,,,,
8,tourism there's such massive amounts of,10:51,,,,
8,tourists that all go to the same spots,10:53,,,,
8,and rightly so why don't you just go to,10:55,,,,
8,other sports what is this where you,10:57,,,,
8,because that is completely different,11:00,,,,
8,than you know more and more people,11:02,,,,
8,becoming digital nomads because there,11:05,,,,
8,are only certain spots in the world,11:06,,,,
8,right now that have that kind of a,11:08,,,,
8,HubSpot status so they're going to,11:10,,,,
8,become completely overfilled and of,11:12,,,,
8,course enjoy on your new favorites I'll,11:15,,,,
8,have to find my new favorites but also,11:16,,,,
8,it's going to it might completely,11:18,,,,
8,transform government policy or some of,11:21,E,2,,
8,the loopholes that you know digital,11:23,,,,
8,nomads have been able to to use or it's,11:26,,,,
8,going to completely change the world,11:28,,,,
8,yeah they're bound to want to find a way,11:30,,,,
8,to tax us eventually in countries like,11:33,,,,
8,Thailand stuff like that rather than,11:35,,,,
8,just you know choice me for a visa,11:37,,,,
8,extension right yeah different kind of,11:40,,,,
8,tax but the thing that I'm afraid of is,11:42,,,,
8,the uncertainty of what the world would,11:45,,,,
8,look like with a lot more digital nomads,11:47,,,,
8,because I love this lifestyle and I,11:50,,,,
8,can't promote it enough for he was doing,11:52,,,,
8,it before it was cool yeah but at the,11:56,,,,
8,same time it's not sustainable for a,11:59,,,,
8,large chunk of the world population I,12:01,,,,
8,think it might be I mean you'll see,12:04,,,,
8,populations declining in expensive,12:07,,,,
8,countries and let's say North America,12:08,,,,
8,and Western well that's an equalizer,12:09,,,,
8,because those more affordable countries,12:12,,,,
8,will have their local economy,12:14,,,,
8,invigorated but the thing to watch is,12:15,,,,
8,like gentrification and crisis being,12:17,,,,
8,raised to the point where locals can,12:20,,,,
8,afford it and stuff like that yeah also,12:22,H,2,A,1
8,a cultural gentrification as well you'll,12:23,,,,
8,see less and less of the like for,12:26,,,,
8,example I I live a couple months a year,12:29,,,,
8,in a place called Nieman which is the,12:31,,,,
8,let's say expat hub the trendy parking,12:35,,,,
8,right yeah but it's also a University,12:37,,,,
8,Center which gives it that coolness as,12:38,,,,
8,well yeah but what would I what I'm,12:41,,,,
8,afraid of is I've been going there for,12:42,,,,
8,three years now and it's becoming more,12:44,,,,
8,and more like other Western cities and,12:48,,,,
8,less and less like Thailand so now if,12:50,,,,
8,you want that authentic Thai experience,12:52,,,,
8,you need to go down there sent to town,12:53,,,,
8,or old town or even further into the,12:55,,,,
8,city as opposed to there and if that,12:58,,,,
8,spreads and that grows and you know,13:00,,,,
8,if that happens to other parts of the,13:01,,,,
8,city as well it might completely,13:03,,,,
8,transform transform it which also from a,13:07,,,,
8,locals perspective which don't have the,13:09,,,,
8,same purchasing power as we do it might,13:11,,,,
8,also be a very negative impact to the,13:14,,,,
8,quality of life of non-western or non,13:17,,,,
8,foreign access in those places too we,13:20,,,,
8,need to think from their precise I guess,13:22,,,,
8,the danger is if some place has a,13:24,,,,
8,natural cool based on the local,13:25,,,,
8,population where people go and they say,13:27,,,,
8,wow this is a cultural center that we,13:30,,,,
8,the foreigners will claim all of those,13:33,,,,
8,places as our own and sort of leave the,13:35,,,,
8,mark on it just like I mean the same,13:37,C,1,,
8,thing has happening happening for,13:39,,,,
8,decades in in cities like Toronto and,13:41,,,,
8,New York where there's this,13:43,,,,
8,working-class neighborhood that has like,13:45,,,,
8,a sort of vibe to it and then the,13:48,,,,
8,artists move in and then the artists you,13:52,,,,
8,know open up their galleries and then,13:53,,,,
8,they they bring in you know working,13:57,,,,
8,afternoon people into that neighborhood,13:59,,,,
8,who then start buying all the places,14:01,,,,
8,that the artists previously found,14:04,,,,
8,desirable to the point where those,14:06,,,,
8,neighborhoods like Berlin is a huge,14:08,,,,
8,example of this gentrification we're,14:10,,,,
8,like the neighbourhoods where the,14:11,,,,
8,artists you know made the name of the,14:12,,,,
8,neighborhood is becomes like the biggest,14:15,,,,
8,real estate boom location of that city,14:19,,,,
8,and the artist can afford to live there,14:21,,,,
8,anymore so we could see the same thing,14:23,A,1,,
8,on an international level because of,14:25,,,,
8,this visual nomadism yeah maybe it's a,14:29,,,,
8,good example you bring up I think,14:30,,,,
8,there's a lot of similarities but also,14:32,,,,
8,the differences of I guess potential,14:36,,,,
8,resentment for foreigners if it's people,14:38,,,,
8,from outside the country coming in and,14:40,,,,
8,bringing outside cash instead of you,14:42,,,,
8,know local artists and then,14:44,,,,
8,entrepreneurs that are taking advantage,14:46,,,,
8,of the opportunity like there's,14:47,,,,
8,similarities there's also some,14:49,,,,
8,differences there but I think from an,14:51,,,,
8,individual perspective individuals in,14:53,,,,
8,the world that have the ability to,14:55,,,,
8,remote work and to travel are going to,14:57,,,,
8,see their quality of lives improved,14:59,,,,
8,greatly so,15:00,,,,
8,from the global perspective there's,15:02,,,,
8,gonna be some winners there's gonna be,15:03,,,,
8,some losers it'll be very interesting to,15:05,,,,
8,see what the world's going to look like,15:06,,,,
8,and there also as we are more and more,15:09,G,1,,
8,in numbers in these place to dos it also,15:11,,,,
8,believes the opportunity for a lot more,15:14,,,,
8,cultural exchange a lot more youth of,15:17,,,,
8,the countries that were were living in,15:19,,,,
8,getting involved in our communities,15:21,,,,
8,learning how to speak English and other,15:22,,,,
8,languages for sure and just becoming you,15:26,,,,
8,know more globalized and more and then,15:29,,,,
8,they will prepare themselves we've seen,15:31,,,,
8,this in Serbia with the people we work,15:33,,,,
8,with there they become more up to speed,15:38,,,,
8,with our global culture just by hanging,15:40,,,,
8,out with us and and they they become you,15:42,,,,
8,know marketable on the on the global,15:45,,,,
8,Internet economy as a result of that so,15:47,,,,
8,well it won't just be rich foreigners,15:50,,,,
8,taking over a place and bring their,15:53,,,,
8,money in the locals are excluded there,15:55,,,,
8,will also be more opportunities for,15:57,D,1,,
8,local inclusion through cultural centers,15:59,,,,
8,language exchanges yeah and and you know,16:02,,,,
8,just hiring as well and I think it's our,16:05,,,,
8,responsibility as foreigners entering a,16:07,,,,
8,country to make sure that we're acting,16:09,,,,
8,and creating experiences in a way that,16:11,,,,
8,can be accessed by both other foreigners,16:14,,,,
8,and also make it accessible to the,16:16,,,,
8,locals and really have an ability to,16:19,,,,
8,contribute positively to the culture I,16:21,,,,
8,think it's our it's on us to kind of,16:22,,,,
8,make those kind of possibilities and,16:25,,,,
8,there's a lot of conferences and events,16:28,,,,
8,where they have two prices they have a,16:30,,,,
8,four hundred price and they have a local,16:32,,,,
8,price for for example Thai or or,16:34,,,,
8,Malaysian ash,16:35,,,,
8,which is lower and that is really,16:37,T,2,Q,3
8,interesting because it creates more of a,16:39,,,,
8,cultural mix and diversity which,16:42,,,,
8,wouldn't be possible if they had a set,16:45,,,,
8,price for both foreigners and locals so,16:48,,,,
8,although you know we foreigners we hate,16:50,,,,
8,double pricing we hate one of the,16:51,,,,
8,markets and paying four times more for,16:54,,,,
8,the same apples that the local did but,16:56,,,,
8,when it comes to foreigners creating and,16:58,,,,
8,curating events in these places I think,17:01,,,,
8,it is good to have that kind of,17:02,,,,
8,separation of prices to make it,17:04,,,,
8,inclusive well I think that's the,17:06,,,,
8,message then that that you should not,17:09,,,,
8,just move to a place to live off of the,17:12,,,,
8,cheap food and accommodation and and,17:15,,,,
8,other stuff in those places you should,17:17,,,,
8,actually sink to if you're a slow,17:19,,,,
8,traveler in a place find a way to,17:22,,,,
8,contribute to the lives of locals there,17:25,F,3,,
8,find a way to create a community that's,17:27,,,,
8,accessible and find a way to you know,17:30,,,,
8,not just feed off of a place but to,17:32,,,,
8,contribute to it that's that's it,17:33,,,,
8,right yeah that's a good message yeah so,17:37,,,,
8,yeah thanks a lot for watching yeah it's,17:39,,,,
8,wow 18 minutes that's pretty good,17:42,,,,

9,actually the beach here in Sri Lanka I'm,1:02,,,,
9,just a block away but I just couldn't,1:04,,,,
9,film out there because it was so backlit,1:06,,,,
9,I should totally have a beach background,1:10,A,2,,
9,but I just like this coffee shop it,1:12,,,,
9,reminds me of Amsterdam yeah it looks,1:15,,,,
9,nice and I do miss going to coffee shops,1:18,,,,
9,I'm working at a coffee shop so it's,1:20,,,,
9,nice to see you in there,1:21,,,,
9,I had a lot of video calls today and I,1:24,,,,
9,was using this background and everybody,1:26,,,,
9,is like commenting they're like did you,1:28,O,1,A,2
9,find a coffee shop that's open during,1:30,,,,
9,the quarantine oh yeah it's funny that,1:34,,,,
9,the things that we miss and a lot of it,1:37,,,,
9,is really just the day-to-day lives of,1:39,,,,
9,going to a coffee shop or go to the gym,1:41,,,,
9,but in this episode what the reason why,1:45,,,,
9,I wanted to have you on is I wanted to,1:47,,,,
9,talk about how life in a lot of ways,1:51,,,,
9,isn't that different for digital nomads,1:52,,,,
9,and how it seems like a lot of our,1:56,,,,
9,friends our Nomad friends are coping,1:58,,,,
9,during this quarantine way better than,2:00,,,,
9,the average person and you actually just,2:03,,,,
9,wrote a really long medium article about,2:04,,,,
9,exactly that right for sure I was,2:08,,,,
9,thinking about it before and then I got,2:10,,,,
9,your email about your podcast,2:13,,,,
9,people call in and record messages and,2:16,,,,
9,it had been on my mind a lot you know,2:19,,,,
9,because we have all this time to think,2:20,,,,
9,and so I left you guys a message and,2:22,A,2,K,2
9,then was happy to come on and talk about,2:25,,,,
9,it so when I was thinking about it and,2:27,,,,
9,taking notes and making a list of all of,2:30,,,,
9,the the reasons why we aren't so,2:32,,,,
9,effective affected it turned into a blog,2:35,,,,
9,post and so I just published it I was,2:38,,,,
9,like well it works be back people really,2:42,,,,
9,like it yeah it's been super well,2:45,,,,
9,written blog post lots of good detail in,2:47,,,,
9,there and we'll link it in the show,2:50,,,,
9,notes of this episode and if you guys,2:52,,,,
9,recognize Kristin's voice she was on,2:55,,,,
9,episode 198 when we were actually,2:57,,,,
9,neighbors and living together in bansko,3:00,,,,
9,Bulgaria I can't believe that was two,3:04,,,,
9,years ago I know right it sounds insane,3:08,,,,
9,almost like almost exactly two years ago,3:11,,,,
9,it's so weird but welcome back and,3:15,,,,
9,actually that that article that you,3:17,,,,
9,posted it was perfect timing that you,3:18,,,,
9,put that up first because we got a few,3:20,T,2,A,2
9,more,3:21,,,,
9,I should have bunch of comments on there,3:23,,,,
9,with the feedback and half of the people,3:26,,,,
9,we're saying you know thank you for,3:29,,,,
9,writing this this is so spot-on this,3:31,,,,
9,actually explains why my life hasn't,3:35,,,,
9,changed that much but I you know and,3:37,,,,
9,I'll actually just read a few of them,3:39,,,,
9,steve says love this article so many of,3:42,,,,
9,mine on digital nomads friends are,3:44,A,1,C,2
9,really struggling stress wise and I,3:47,,,,
9,couldn't pinpoint and why I'm dealing,3:49,,,,
9,well with sincerity and I've been,3:51,,,,
9,feeling guilty that I'm handling it so,3:53,,,,
9,well Kristen's well-thought-out article,3:56,,,,
9,perfectly explained the why thanks and,3:59,,,,
9,we got a couple more of those too Corey,4:01,,,,
9,says great articles spot on with what's,4:03,,,,
9,going on in my mind almost to the point,4:05,,,,
9,of feeling a bit selfish that I'm not,4:08,,,,
9,feeling much difference at all and Kevin,4:12,,,,
9,says yep I agree too we have a six out,4:15,,,,
9,of four-year-old and we're in Tulum,4:17,O,2,,
9,Mexico now skating lockdown in San Diego,4:20,,,,
9,it's a shame that we can't go to,4:21,,,,
9,restaurants or visit the gym apart but,4:23,,,,
9,our life other than these services or,4:27,,,,
9,same we still homeschool on the road,4:29,,,,
9,it's normal and work as normal so before,4:32,,,,
9,we get to the the downsides or for the,4:36,,,,
9,people that are not true and just to,4:38,,,,
9,stipulate this you know we know that,4:40,,,,
9,there's a lot of people who are going,4:42,,,,
9,through you know bigger struggles,4:44,,,,
9,whether someone's actually sick and in,4:47,,,,
9,immediate danger of afterword of death,4:50,,,,
9,or illness there's some people who,4:52,,,,
9,really are financially struggling and,4:54,,,,
9,some people are really bad you know,4:55,,,,
9,situations so our condolences to these,4:58,,,,
9,people we feel bad generally bad for,5:00,,,,
9,these people but this episode is really,5:03,,,,
9,gonna be about the other 99% of people,5:06,,,,
9,who don't seem like they're struggling,5:07,,,,
9,that much in our kind of circle and,5:10,,,,
9,let's stop first talk about some of the,5:13,,,,
9,you know let's let's talk about the pros,5:14,,,,
9,and cons of it because you know we had,5:16,,,,
9,these to me messages of people you know,5:18,O,1,,
9,saying hey life really isn't that bad,5:20,,,,
9,and I was feeling bad that my life isn't,5:21,,,,
9,a bad why is that and then we'll talk,5:24,,,,
9,about the other side as well so why do,5:26,,,,
9,you think it is,5:27,,,,
9,yeah there's this guilt that I think a,5:30,,,,
9,lot of digital nomads have been feeling,5:33,,,,
9,silently and didn't say anything about,5:35,,,,
9,it and I didn't realize it until I,5:37,,,,
9,posted this blog and I got those,5:39,,,,
9,comments because um yeah nobody wants to,5:43,,,,
9,say like hey it's not that bad because,5:47,,,,
9,they feel bad about it but one thing,5:50,,,,
9,I've learned with vlogging and writing,5:53,F,2,,
9,is that you shouldn't had you should,5:54,,,,
9,just tell it like it is and it's gonna,5:56,,,,
9,resonate with people better thank you,5:58,,,,
9,for listening to the choppa like a boss,6:00,,,,
9,podcast if you want to hear more,6:02,,,,
9,including the bonus how to choose the,6:04,,,,
9,perfect in each episode join I made a,6:05,,,,
9,little Sam travel like a boss podcast,6:07,,,,
9,calm see you next week and remember if,6:10,,,,
9,you want to travel like a boss I'm gonna,6:12,,,,
10,hi everybody this is liam martin from,0:02,I,1,,
10,running around and,0:03,,,,
10,today we're going to be talking about,0:05,,,,
10,where will remote work be,0:07,,,,
10,after the pandemic we are currently,0:10,,,,
10,leaving the pandemic,0:11,,,,
10,right now and it is a situation in which,0:14,B,2,,
10,remote work has seen the greatest rise,0:17,,,,
10,in the history of its existence but,0:20,,,,
10,we've also,0:20,,,,
10,seen a lot of negatives pop up as well,0:24,,,,
10,working from home is not remote work,0:26,,,,
10,there's a lot of negative feedback loops,0:28,,,,
10,that are associated with this entire,0:30,F,3,,
10,situation but i have some data that i,0:32,,,,
10,want to show you to be able to kind of,0:33,,,,
10,give you an,0:34,,,,
10,inkling of where we're going to go with,0:36,,,,
10,remote work this has massive,0:37,,,,
10,implications,0:38,,,,
10,if you are a remote company owner and it,0:41,,,,
10,also has massive implications if you're,0:43,,,,
10,thinking about,0:44,,,,
10,going remote stay tuned so a curtain,0:46,I,2,,
10,piece in routers,0:47,,,,
10,expecting to,0:50,,,,
10,just stated that 74 of cfos are,0:50,,,,
10,in part or completely remain remote,0:53,,,,
10,after,0:54,,,,
10,the entire coveted situation is over,0:57,,,,
10,now if you actually look at that data in,0:59,,,,
10,a deeper way,1:00,B,2,A,2
10,it shows that about two percent of those,1:04,,,,
10,cfos are thinking of moving completely,1:06,,,,
10,over remote but,1:07,,,,
10,a lot of them are thinking of keeping,1:09,,,,
10,twenty to thirty percent of their team's,1:11,,,,
10,remote in a quote-unquote co-located,1:15,,,,
10,working environment i don't know whether,1:16,,,,
10,or not that's going to work out too well,1:18,,,,
10,to be completely honest with you,1:19,,,,
10,i kind of see these dualistic teams with,1:22,,,,
10,remote teams and in office teams,1:25,,,,
10,not working long term reason being is,1:28,,,,
10,founder islands basically employees that,1:31,,,,
10,are able to go into the office,1:32,,,,
10,feel like they have a higher level of,1:35,,,,
10,authority than people that,1:36,,,,
10,are not inside of the office so i think,1:39,,,,
10,that that's actually almost kind of a,1:41,,,,
10,stepping stone towards a remote first,1:43,,,,
10,organization but again this is very,1:46,,,,
10,interesting data that is coming,1:48,D,2,A,2
10,out of the postcode situation there was,1:50,,,,
10,a very interesting portuguese article,1:52,,,,
10,that i ended up having,1:54,,,,
10,my friend gonzalo translate for me which,1:56,,,,
10,was,1:57,,,,
10,super helpful and they did a study,2:00,,,,
10,of remote workers in portugal and i,2:02,,,,
10,believe,2:03,,,,
10,through the rest of europe and they,2:06,,,,
10,stated that 65,2:07,,,,
10,of workers want to stay working,2:11,,,,
10,remotely at least in europe also 59,2:15,,,,
10,of bosses believe that remote work is,2:16,,,,
10,going to be a long-term solution for,2:18,,,,
10,them,2:19,,,,
10,and the interesting third fact which was,2:23,,,,
10,super relevant is even with a work from,2:25,,,,
10,home situation where you have,2:27,,,,
10,children at home you have unprepared,2:29,,,,
10,workspaces all that kind of stuff,2:31,,,,
10,45 of employers,2:34,B,2,A,2
10,say that productivity and revenue,2:37,,,,
10,increased due to the covid work from,2:40,,,,
10,home situation,2:41,,,,
10,instead of decrease this is absolutely,2:43,,,,
10,huge,2:44,,,,
10,when you're trying to understand what,2:46,,,,
10,the heck is going on in terms of remote,2:48,,,,
10,work,2:49,,,,
10,because you're earning back the two to,2:51,,,,
10,three hours of commute time,2:53,B,1,C,2
10,that you usually would have used to be,2:55,,,,
10,able to go to,2:57,,,,
10,work and back from work you're basically,3:00,,,,
10,adding that,3:01,,,,
10,into that person's workday or they're,3:03,,,,
10,literally just getting an extra three,3:05,,,,
10,hours of,3:06,,,,
10,sleep per day so it's absolutely,3:08,,,,
10,unbeatable and to me,3:09,,,,
10,something that is a real game changer,3:12,,,,
10,when you're starting to see these types,3:13,,,,
10,of numbers,3:14,,,,
10,where even under the worst of,3:16,B,2,,
10,circumstances not remote work but a work,3:18,,,,
10,from home situation,3:19,,,,
10,productivity has gone up in 45 percent,3:22,,,,
10,of cases,3:23,,,,
10,there's also this other study in the,3:24,,,,
10,brookings institute which is,3:27,,,,
10,really telling they state that about 50,3:29,,,,
10,percent of the us workforce is currently,3:31,,,,
10,working remotely which is quite,3:34,,,,
10,interesting,3:35,,,,
10,um i think that number is actually a,3:37,,,,
10,little bit lower and the reason why i,3:38,,,,
10,think it's lower is in the same article,3:40,,,,
10,they state that if you make over one,3:42,,,,
10,hundred thousand dollars a year you are,3:44,,,,
10,four times more likely to be able to,3:46,,,,
10,work remotely,3:47,,,,
10,than somebody who is in the bottom,3:48,,,,
10,quartile of income earners,3:51,,,,
10,in the united states so basically what,3:53,,,,
10,this means,3:54,,,,
10,is the poorer you are the lower your,3:56,,,,
10,chance of working remotely,3:58,,,,
10,the higher you're paid the higher your,4:00,,,,
10,chance of working remotely,4:02,,,,
10,78 of us households have high speed,4:05,C,3,,
10,internet versus 56,4:06,,,,
10,globally and the reality is is that,4:09,,,,
10,remote work is going to be moving,4:11,,,,
10,into all of these places at breakneck,4:13,,,,
10,speed,4:14,,,,
10,so i think what's going to end up,4:16,,,,
10,happening and this is just my own,4:18,,,,
10,earners,4:21,,,,
10,theory on this is high-end income,4:21,,,,
10,are going to be able to work remotely,4:23,,,,
10,and those jobs,4:24,,,,
10,will actually start to get quote-unquote,4:27,,,,
10,outsourced,4:28,,,,
10,or competed on globally very,4:31,B,2,,
10,very soon so what do i mean by that well,4:33,,,,
10,google,4:34,,,,
10,facebook twitter shopify,4:37,,,,
10,they've all gone remote these are all,4:40,,,,
10,six figure,4:41,,,,
10,job type positions and they have,4:44,,,,
10,hundreds of thousands,4:45,,,,
10,of workers redfin which is a real estate,4:48,,,,
10,data mining company,4:50,,,,
10,has shown that san francisco has,4:52,,,,
10,actually had,4:53,,,,
10,the largest amount of activity of people,4:56,,,,
10,searching for homes that are not,4:58,,,,
10,inside of san francisco right after,5:01,,,,
10,covid started,5:02,,,,
10,so basically what's happening is all of,5:04,,,,
10,these employees that are,5:05,,,,
10,very very wealthy have been told hey you,5:08,,,,
10,can now work remotely and what they're,5:10,,,,
10,doing,5:10,,,,
10,is they are not staying in san francisco,5:12,C,2,,
10,dollars,5:14,,,,
10,where a one bedroom costs four thousand,5:14,,,,
10,and for four thousand dollars a month,5:16,,,,
10,you can get an amazing six-bedroom,5:19,,,,
10,mansion in the midwest so they're,5:21,,,,
10,leaving on mass and i think this is,5:23,,,,
10,going to be a phenomenon that we're,5:24,,,,
10,going to see in the next three to nine,5:26,,,,
10,months,5:27,,,,
10,in a big way once this remote work stuff,5:30,,,,
10,really locks in and coronavirus starts,5:33,,,,
10,to drop off,5:34,,,,
10,so you're going to see all that labor,5:36,,,,
10,not only redistribute to the united,5:37,E,3,,
10,states but i also think globally so i,5:39,,,,
10,also think,5:40,,,,
10,digital nomadism is going to go through,5:43,,,,
10,the roof within the next,5:46,,,,
10,one to one and a half years in my,5:48,,,,
10,opinion basically,5:49,,,,
10,post-vaccine now the other thing that's,5:52,,,,
10,really important,5:53,,,,
10,is once all of this labor disconnects,5:56,,,,
10,from geography,5:58,,,,
10,we're going to see a massive competition,6:02,,,,
10,for that talent give you a perfect,6:04,,,,
10,example we ended up hiring,6:06,,,,
10,someone who got a top five finish at the,6:10,,,,
10,facebook hackathon,6:11,,,,
10,this person just happened to live in,6:12,A,3,,
10,bangladesh and they decided to take a,6:15,,,,
10,salary from,6:16,,,,
10,us for honestly about 10th of what they,6:19,,,,
10,would be paid,6:20,,,,
10,in san francisco reason being is this,6:22,,,,
10,person didn't want to go to san,6:23,,,,
10,francisco,6:24,,,,
10,and make mid six figures they wanted to,6:27,,,,
10,stay,6:28,,,,
10,in bangladesh and live with their family,6:31,,,,
10,still an absolute top tier person but,6:33,,,,
10,the reason why,6:34,,,,
10,facebook ended up not giving him the job,6:36,,,,
10,was because,6:38,,,,
10,that,6:41,,,,
10,they didn't accept remote positions well,6:41,,,,
10,is now ceased to exist all of these,6:44,,,,
10,companies are going to be accepting,6:45,,,,
10,ramote employees on mass,6:47,,,,
10,and the competition for those jobs are,6:49,,,,
10,literally going to,6:50,,,,
10,10 to 20x in my opinion,6:53,,,,
10,over the next three to four years there,6:56,,,,
10,will be very,6:57,,,,
10,few top tier jobs that are actually,7:00,E,2,,
10,employed inside of the united states,7:03,,,,
10,economy,7:05,,,,
10,even when we talk about the digital,7:05,,,,
10,so that's a very interesting insight,7:08,,,,
10,that's my theory,7:09,,,,
10,it'll be very interesting to see what,7:10,,,,
10,happens over the next two years if you,7:12,,,,
10,guys like these videos i'm gonna put up,7:14,,,,
10,a bunch of them just on a regular basis,7:16,,,,
10,because i read these articles all the,7:17,,,,
10,time,7:18,,,,
10,and i'm thinking maybe i just sort of,7:19,A,2,,
10,jump in front of the camera and,7:21,,,,
10,tell you my thoughts on it because stuff,7:23,,,,
10,is literally happening,7:24,,,,
10,every single day so if you like this,7:26,F,3,,
10,video give it a thumbs up let me know,7:28,,,,
10,whether or not,7:29,,,,
10,you want me to make more of these videos,7:31,,,,
10,and if you really like this video,7:33,,,,
10,subscribe to this youtube channel it's,7:34,,,,
10,completely free and we talk about this,7:36,,,,
10,weird stuff,7:36,,,,
11,hey folks it's eric and tal from support,0:02,B,1,,
11,adventure how's it going kel,0:04,,,,
11,good how are you good well it's been,0:06,,,,
11,quite the year i mean we,0:07,,,,
11,last made this video about being a,0:09,,,,
11,digital nomad in the coronavirus era,0:12,,,,
11,when we were,0:12,K,2,,
11,sitting in thailand remember how it was,0:15,,,,
11,to be stuck,0:16,,,,
11,on that island it was paradise it wasn't,0:19,,,,
11,so bad looking back um,0:20,,,,
11,you know but back in that was back in,0:22,,,,
11,march that we recorded that last video i,0:24,,,,
11,think or april or something like that,0:26,K,3,,
11,and well now we know a lot more about,0:29,,,,
11,what's gonna happen,0:30,,,,
11,to our um sort of type of people,0:34,,,,
11,digital nomads and well um okay so let's,0:37,,,,
11,backtrack,0:38,,,,
11,since thailand i felt the call to come,0:40,,,,
11,back to uh serbia where i have my,0:42,,,,
11,base set up essentially and you,0:45,,,,
11,basically stayed on the island in,0:46,,,,
11,thailand,0:46,A,2,,
11,and well i mean i also visited belarus,0:51,,,,
11,and turkey since then and,0:52,,,,
11,i can say that it's it's really nice,0:54,,,,
11,that i was able to visit,0:55,,,,
11,belarus in turkey but um the other,0:58,,,,
11,countries i could have visited,0:59,,,,
11,well they're the pickings are fairly,1:01,,,,
11,slim let's say so,1:03,G,2,A,2
11,you went back to canada so um,1:06,,,,
11,i haven't been apart from one day,1:08,,,,
11,stopover in,1:09,,,,
11,london i haven't been uh in a western,1:12,,,,
11,quote-unquote country,1:13,,,,
11,um since then so what was it like in,1:16,,,,
11,canada compared to thailand,1:18,,,,
11,well i came to canada in august right,1:21,,,,
11,after they went,1:22,,,,
11,into green zone which means that,1:25,,,,
11,everything was open,1:26,,,,
11,so i think i i was very lucky to have a,1:30,,,,
11,pretty normal experience in canada which,1:32,C,1,,
11,i didn't expect,1:33,,,,
11,but while we were in thailand canada was,1:36,,,,
11,a very different story everything was,1:37,,,,
11,closed,1:38,,,,
11,people were afraid to come out you see a,1:40,,,,
11,lot of masks on the streets and cases,1:42,,,,
11,well,1:44,,,,
11,went up and up and up a lot of deaths as,1:44,A,2,C,2
11,when i got there people were starting to,1:46,,,,
11,be more relaxed starting to,1:49,,,,
11,you know go out to the bars in the,1:50,,,,
11,restaurants a little bit,1:53,,,,
11,montreal was very felt very normal to be,1:56,,,,
11,honest,1:57,,,,
11,my friends were throwing house parties,1:58,,,,
11,at that point all the restaurants were,2:00,,,,
11,full of people,2:01,,,,
11,you do see a lot more masks though less,2:03,,,,
11,than thailand but more than,2:05,,,,
11,what i later found to be in serbia yeah,2:07,,,,
11,so now we're sitting in serbia and um do,2:09,,,,
11,you find that the attitude of people in,2:11,,,,
11,canada is different than in serbia,2:13,,,,
11,basically yeah definitely and,2:14,,,,
11,uh as i left now canada has its second,2:17,,,,
11,wave even more cases than the first one,2:18,,,,
11,so,2:19,,,,
11,right now it's a very different story,2:21,,,,
11,the ontario premier is telling people to,2:24,J,1,A,2
11,close their circles to just three people,2:25,,,,
11,so i was very lucky i came right when it,2:27,,,,
11,got good and i left right before it went,2:29,,,,
11,bad so,2:30,,,,
11,so yeah i mean i think that cities like,2:32,,,,
11,toronto new york london are seeing a,2:35,,,,
11,huge exodus,2:36,,,,
11,of people outside of those cities so i,2:38,,,,
11,mean my basic impression is that the,2:40,,,,
11,long-term prognosis for us digital,2:42,S,1,C,2
11,nomads is uh,2:43,,,,
11,looking good that this lifestyle is more,2:45,,,,
11,embraced now than ever,2:46,,,,
11,that companies have become a lot more,2:49,,,,
11,open-minded,2:50,,,,
11,uh for you know remote working models,2:53,,,,
11,than they were previously,2:55,,,,
11,and um that's all good news but in terms,2:58,,,,
11,of where you can go today,2:59,,,,
11,i mean what's it gonna look like over,3:01,,,,
11,the next six months because okay,3:03,,,,
11,you see more and more countries are,3:05,,,,
11,opening up by the day for example south,3:07,D,2,,
11,africa just opened,3:08,,,,
11,you need to have a pcr test uh,3:10,,,,
11,coronavirus test negative before you go,3:12,,,,
11,to,3:12,,,,
11,you're seeing lots of that sort of stuff,3:14,,,,
11,um so essentially what it means for us,3:16,,,,
11,digital nomads is,3:18,,,,
11,um i think as we touched on in the first,3:21,,,,
11,video,3:21,F,3,,
11,more slow travel right yeah like you're,3:24,,,,
11,coming here,3:25,,,,
11,to stay in serbia for like at least a,3:27,,,,
11,couple months right,3:28,,,,
11,yeah just because you can and and just,3:32,,,,
11,because it's a friendly place where,3:33,,,,
11,things aren't too crazy where it's,3:35,,,,
11,still possible to have a normal life and,3:37,,,,
11,um you know people aren't absolutely,3:39,,,,
11,hysterical about this thing like they're,3:41,,,,
11,in other places,3:42,,,,
11,and so yeah slow travel i mean i'm in,3:46,,,,
11,the position right now where i'm,3:47,,,,
11,thinking of where i'm gonna go for the,3:48,,,,
11,winter,3:49,,,,
11,um middle of october or start of october,3:52,,,,
11,as we record this video,3:54,A,3,,
11,middle of october is starting next week,3:56,,,,
11,and um,3:57,,,,
11,i'm just gonna go on a little road trip,3:58,,,,
11,in turkey for my holiday and then i'm,4:00,,,,
11,going to relocate to find somewhere to,4:02,,,,
11,work,4:02,,,,
11,the pickings are quite slim at this,4:04,,,,
11,point i prefer asia i know after how,4:06,,,,
11,long did you stay in asia,4:07,,,,
11,11 months last year way too long yeah,4:09,,,,
11,you're all asianed out but um,4:11,,,,
11,you know like i would like to get back,4:13,,,,
11,there at some point over the winter,4:15,,,,
11,we'll see if it's possible and you know,4:17,S,2,,
11,like my,4:18,,,,
11,overall impression is that,4:21,,,,
11,you know the countries that do have the,4:25,,,,
11,sort of uh courage to open up their,4:28,,,,
11,borders again,4:29,,,,
11,despite the fact that it might bring a,4:31,,,,
11,little bit of infection,4:33,,,,
11,countries like that,4:36,,,,
11,like turkey like serbia and other,4:36,,,,
11,i mean they're gonna get the taurus you,4:39,,,,
11,had a,4:42,,,,
11,know a lot of people you said that you,4:42,,,,
11,american friend who's just here because,4:44,,,,
11,he can be here and,4:45,,,,
11,it's one of the few countries where you,4:47,,,,
11,can go as an american right now,4:49,,,,
11,for example and a lot of people are in,4:51,,,,
11,the same situation with turkey,4:53,,,,
11,and countries like albania and belarus,4:55,,,,
11,even and so it's,4:58,,,,
11,us digital nomads are essentially voting,5:02,A,2,,
11,with our money like um we're,5:05,,,,
11,contributing we're happy to go places,5:07,,,,
11,and spend our money,5:08,,,,
11,and it feels really good to be able to,5:10,,,,
11,do that still in this in this climate,5:13,,,,
11,and uh the countries that open up are,5:14,,,,
11,the ones we're going to go to as simple,5:16,,,,
11,as that the ones where we can,5:18,,,,
11,actually be welcomed without going into,5:20,,,,
11,countries,5:22,,,,
11,quarantine we're going to those,5:22,,,,
11,and so slow travel will mean that we'll,5:25,,,,
11,stay longer,5:26,,,,
11,and settle down a little more yeah and,5:29,C,3,,
11,also for myself i found my values,5:31,,,,
11,changed in the last year,5:32,,,,
11,now i value stability a lot more i value,5:35,,,,
11,to deepen my roots in a place and really,5:37,,,,
11,get to know it better and i think a part,5:39,,,,
11,of that is because of the lack of,5:41,,,,
11,opportunity to easily cross borders and,5:44,,,,
11,you know i don't have as much of a,5:46,,,,
11,choice anxiety of having every single,5:48,,,,
11,country open to me in the world,5:50,,,,
11,which is a privilege when you take that,5:52,,,,
11,privilege away you really start to,5:54,,,,
11,cherish other aspects of life for,5:55,,,,
11,example,5:56,,,,
11,uh geographic stability so yeah maybe if,5:59,,,,
11,other digital nomads feel,6:00,A,3,,
11,similarly it makes it easier it makes,6:03,,,,
11,the choice easier if there's only four,6:05,,,,
11,countries you can go,6:06,,,,
11,to and you're in one of them and you,6:08,,,,
11,like it i recall seeing something like,6:10,,,,
11,in life,6:12,,,,
11,uh study that people have more choices,6:12,,,,
11,are less happy so um,6:16,,,,
11,yeah personally being stuck on that,6:17,,,,
11,island in thailand for two and a half,6:19,,,,
11,months uh,6:20,,,,
11,or almost three months gave me a really,6:22,,,,
11,good way of,6:23,,,,
11,uh stabilizing myself because before,6:26,,,,
11,that,6:27,,,,
11,i mean in september i was in colombia,6:28,,,,
11,then came back to europe and then i'm in,6:31,,,,
11,october to thailand then in november i,6:33,,,,
11,flew to california,6:35,,,,
11,and then back to thailand then back to,6:37,,,,
11,europe then to canada for,6:38,,,,
11,christmas and then i came back to serbia,6:42,,,,
11,in europe and took a road trip to greece,6:44,,,,
11,and came back to belgrade,6:45,,,,
11,then i went to south africa then i came,6:47,E,2,,
11,back to belgrade and then i had five,6:49,,,,
11,days here and i'm like should i go this,6:51,,,,
11,corona is getting real,6:53,,,,
11,and so i went and i was stuck there for,6:55,,,,
11,two and a half months and when i got,6:56,,,,
11,back to belgrade two and a half months,6:58,,,,
11,here,6:59,,,,
11,and you know i can say that um,7:02,,,,
11,my routines are a lot better now,7:06,,,,
11,that i've been here i mean like um just,7:09,,,,
11,setting up a routine and setting up some,7:11,,,,
11,go,7:13,A,2,,
11,roots in a place and knowing where you,7:13,,,,
11,your favorite restaurants your favorite,7:15,,,,
11,people to hang out with your favorite,7:17,,,,
11,place to go for a bike ride or something,7:19,,,,
11,like that,7:20,,,,
11,it's very important and you know when i,7:22,,,,
11,was whizzing around the world,7:23,,,,
11,it's very good to know what's out there,7:24,,,,
11,now and where i can go and,7:27,,,,
11,the types of regions and how to get,7:28,,,,
11,there and all that stuff but,7:31,,,,
11,i'm looking this winter to actually as,7:34,,,,
11,quickly as possible replicate the,7:35,,,,
11,lifestyle that i can,7:37,,,,
11,you know sort of have the routines and,7:38,,,,
11,set down some roots like i have here so,7:40,,,,
11,i mean what what are my options now,7:44,,,,
11,mexico and brazil both sound very,7:46,,,,
11,interesting i've only ever stopped in,7:48,,,,
11,mexico for,7:49,,,,
11,six hours and i've been to brazil never,7:51,,,,
11,before in my life,7:53,,,,
11,so it's all very intriguing and it's all,7:55,,,,
11,very,7:56,F,3,,
11,mysterious but those countries are,7:57,,,,
11,getting hit hard by the coronavirus,7:59,,,,
11,i'm not really that afraid of getting,8:01,,,,
11,sick but you know it does factor into,8:03,,,,
11,the way,8:05,,,,
11,that your experience as a digital nomad,8:07,,,,
11,will be in those places,8:09,,,,
11,so you have to consider that you have to,8:11,,,,
11,consider the restrictions for entry,8:13,,,,
11,and also the restrictions on daily life,8:14,,,,
11,and how much worse you can get so,8:16,,,,
11,brazil's pretty um somehow attractive,8:20,,,,
11,because i i feel like how much worse,8:22,,,,
11,could it get in that country and how,8:23,,,,
11,much worse is it going to get and it's,8:24,F,3,,
11,somewhere there now and it's,8:26,,,,
11,probably going to start getting better,8:27,,,,
11,so i'm considering going there,8:28,,,,
11,apparently the bars are open uh they're,8:30,,,,
11,closed like some days a week on,8:32,,,,
11,monday and tuesday because you only get,8:34,,,,
11,coronavirus on uh,8:36,,,,
11,on tuesday if you go out yeah but,8:38,,,,
11,they're open in the weekends,8:39,,,,
11,at the weekends and um basically i mean,8:42,,,,
11,that sounds good,8:43,Q,2,A,1
11,i want to yeah there's also this the,8:45,,,,
11,feeling that you could uh,8:47,,,,
11,go in a country and not experience like,8:49,,,,
11,the real vibe of a country because,8:51,,,,
11,of this time well yeah you bring a good,8:54,,,,
11,point i mean the whole pandemic,8:55,,,,
11,we're globally experiencing we're all in,8:57,,,,
11,this together but,8:58,,,,
11,the difference is that uh different,9:00,,,,
11,cities have different experiences,9:02,,,,
11,for example when i was in bangkok nearly,9:04,,,,
11,everybody is wearing masks,9:05,,,,
11,even though everything was open same in,9:07,,,,
11,istanbul yeah in toronto,9:09,,,,
11,less people is wearing masks but you,9:11,,,,
11,know some things might be closed and,9:12,,,,
11,people are much more cautious,9:14,,,,
11,in belgrade i feel like i'm in an,9:16,,,,
11,alternate universe where there is no,9:17,,,,
11,coronavirus and there's parties and,9:19,,,,
11,nightclubs and yeah,9:20,,,,
11,really so i feel like different places,9:23,,,,
11,have very different vibes and feelings,9:25,E,2,,
11,and uh as you travel as you choose where,9:28,,,,
11,you want to go,9:29,,,,
11,people might consider what it is now,9:31,,,,
11,given the pandemic situation and given,9:33,,,,
11,people's reactions to it and you know,9:36,,,,
11,yeah i feel like,9:37,,,,
11,um whatever this thing is people in,9:39,,,,
11,serbia have lived through worse,9:41,,,,
11,as a nation as a people in the 90s and,9:43,,,,
11,all that stuff and,9:45,,,,
11,you know it's it's always sort of,9:47,,,,
11,they're very skeptical about the,9:49,,,,
11,sort of uh rulers,9:53,,,,
11,and what they say for example they,9:55,,,,
11,announced another lockdown and within,9:57,,,,
11,two hours of that there were thousands,9:58,,,,
11,of people outside of the parliament,9:59,,,,
11,guess what the government,10:00,,,,
11,cancelled the lockdown because they know,10:03,,,,
11,that well,10:04,,,,
11,it wasn't going to work out for them,10:05,,,,
11,well if they did another lockdown and i,10:08,,,,
11,don't really see a difference,10:09,,,,
11,having visited belarus i don't really,10:11,,,,
11,see how they're much worse off having,10:13,,,,
11,had no lockdown whatsoever,10:15,H,2,A,1
11,than serbia who had or you know the,10:18,,,,
11,other countries where they had that sort,10:19,,,,
11,of thing,10:20,,,,
11,so i still don't know what the thing is,10:22,,,,
11,with coronavirus yeah,10:24,,,,
11,i mean what the correlation is whether,10:27,,,,
11,the lockdowns,10:28,,,,
11,work um whether the masks work all that,10:30,,,,
11,stuff because the numbers here are,10:31,,,,
11,pretty calm compared to the rest of the,10:32,,,,
11,europe right now,10:33,,,,
11,so at the same and it kind of just comes,10:36,,,,
11,down to the fact that i don't want to,10:38,,,,
11,get,10:38,,,,
11,sick and i'm probably not going to get,10:40,,,,
11,sick so i'll take all reasonable,10:42,,,,
11,precautions like i'm going to go in the,10:44,,,,
11,store if they have a sign this is wear a,10:45,,,,
11,mask i do that,10:47,,,,
11,when i touch something when i leave the,10:48,,,,
11,store i use hand sanitizer and those are,10:50,,,,
11,just my basic precautions you know and a,10:52,,,,
11,little bit,10:53,,,,
11,after i shake someone's hand hand,10:54,,,,
11,sanitizer yeah definitely,10:56,,,,
11,and i've always been like that and this,10:57,,,,
11,sort of pandemic has allowed me to i was,11:00,,,,
11,a closet sort of uh,11:02,,,,
11,germaphobe and and now i'm able to sort,11:04,,,,
11,of be uh,11:06,,,,
11,out and flamboyant yeah i just touched,11:09,,,,
11,your hands so nothing personal buddy but,11:11,,,,
11,i'm gonna sanitize,11:12,C,1,,
11,i have got a little pump in my backpack,11:14,,,,
11,that has a bottle of,11:16,,,,
11,hand sanitizer take care of the,11:19,,,,
11,germaphobes,11:20,,,,
11,the year of the germaphobes and you know,11:23,,,,
11,i i get sick a lot less than other,11:24,,,,
11,people,11:25,,,,
11,and but there's also something to be,11:28,,,,
11,said for going outside,11:30,,,,
11,and not being afraid like i'm not afraid,11:32,,,,
11,i just take the reasonable,11:33,,,,
11,because the worst thing is being afraid,11:36,,,,
11,of things that you can't control,11:38,,,,
11,so take all reasonable precautions that,11:40,,,,
11,you can to control it,11:42,,,,
11,but don't be afraid of the things you,11:43,,,,
11,can't control and,11:45,,,,
11,don't sacrifice your lifestyle and,11:48,,,,
11,yeah i mean now if you can have a remote,11:51,,,,
11,job i mean,11:52,A,1,,
11,flights are more expensive but,11:54,,,,
11,accommodation can be cheaper in places,11:56,,,,
11,yeah so where you can go you can find,11:58,,,,
11,better deals,11:59,,,,
11,in the places that you uh that you find,12:03,,,,
11,yourself in,12:03,,,,
11,um you'll have more space for yourself,12:07,,,,
11,that may be a good or bad thing,12:08,,,,
11,depending on what you're looking for but,12:11,,,,
11,definitely the future is looking bright,12:14,,,,
11,for us digital nomads,12:16,,,,
11,yeah and i think there's going to be a,12:17,,,,
11,lot more of us i know a few friends that,12:19,,,,
11,are now working remotely and they've,12:20,,,,
11,moved to other cities within their,12:22,,,,
11,country,12:23,,,,
11,a few of them have gone abroad not as,12:24,,,,
11,many as i would have thought,12:26,,,,
11,but now that people are working from,12:27,,,,
11,home and working remote they're thinking,12:29,,,,
11,you know what else is there out there,12:31,,,,
11,especially people in hard-hit cities,12:33,,,,
11,like new york and san francisco and,12:34,G,1,,
11,london,12:36,,,,
11,where there's a lot of people there's a,12:37,,,,
11,lot of pollution they have to commute,12:39,,,,
11,and things and all that's all the stuff,12:41,,,,
11,that was good was like you,12:42,,,,
11,go in an office and then after you go to,12:46,,,,
11,the,12:46,,,,
11,you know nightlife in manhattan or,12:49,,,,
11,something like that and,12:50,,,,
11,all that stuff the office is dead the,12:52,,,,
11,nightlife is dead,12:53,,,,
11,why live in a shoebox in new york when,12:55,,,,
11,more,12:57,,,,
11,you can actually live in a place that's,12:57,,,,
11,livable has more breathing space and is,13:01,,,,
11,probably a lot cheaper even in if you,13:04,,,,
11,stay in the u.s for example probably a,13:05,,,,
11,lot cheaper,13:07,,,,
11,but if you come to a country like serbia,13:09,D,1,,
11,well it's,13:10,,,,
11,a third the cost probably and so,13:14,,,,
11,what are we and and more interesting and,13:16,,,,
11,more exotic and you can be somebody,13:18,,,,
11,special,13:19,,,,
11,there you know like if you're an,13:21,,,,
11,american living in america guess what,13:23,,,,
11,most of the other people that are,13:24,,,,
11,americans you're not gonna,13:27,,,,
11,experience that much that's new or,13:29,,,,
11,surprising to you and you're not gonna,13:30,,,,
11,be that special for the people that you,13:32,,,,
11,meet you're just going to be another,13:34,,,,
11,person in the rat race you're just going,13:35,,,,
11,to be if you stay in a city like that in,13:37,,,,
11,your home country,13:38,,,,
11,but if you get out there and become a,13:40,,,,
11,digital nomad,13:41,,,,
11,um i mean well guess what,13:45,,,,
11,there's a whole world out there and,13:48,Q,2,N,3
11,unless you've been to all the countries,13:49,,,,
11,already,13:50,,,,
11,you should entertain the possibility,13:52,,,,
11,that there might be one out there that,13:53,,,,
11,suits you,13:54,,,,
11,or is more interesting or livable for,13:56,,,,
11,you than the one you were born in,13:58,,,,
11,does that make sense yeah i mean like,14:01,,,,
11,there's so much out,14:02,,,,
11,there there's so like whatever you want,14:04,,,,
11,whatever you want like if you want,14:05,,,,
11,hot cold space crowded all that stuff,14:09,,,,
11,i mean the crowded is out of style this,14:10,,,,
11,year because of the whole thing but um,14:13,,,,
11,you know there's there's places that are,14:14,,,,
11,gonna back bounce back and,14:16,,,,
11,there's you know like um the way that,14:19,,,,
11,the future is looking for people like us,14:21,,,,
11,is very good,14:23,,,,
11,indeed and so if you if you ever wanted,14:26,,,,
11,to try it it's time to start,14:28,A,3,,
11,you know sitting down and making a plan,14:30,,,,
11,on what sort of lifestyle you want doing,14:32,,,,
11,the research,14:33,,,,
11,and then once it's possible to go,14:34,,,,
11,somewhere you go and do that you go,14:37,,,,
11,and you just pull the trigger and try it,14:38,,,,
11,out and,14:40,,,,
11,if you try it out you probably won't,14:42,,,,
11,regret it ever because you only,14:44,,,,
11,regret the things that you didn't try in,14:46,,,,
11,general,14:47,,,,
11,so i mean,14:51,,,,
11,just get out there folks it's don't be,14:53,,,,
11,afraid i mean,14:55,,,,
11,just don't let fear dictate your life,14:57,,,,
11,yeah,14:58,,,,
11,so it's not that bad um to sum it up i'm,15:01,F,3,,
11,very,15:02,,,,
11,hopeful about the feature of being a,15:04,,,,
11,digital nomad and i'm very happy,15:06,,,,
11,that i've had the opportunity to um,15:09,,,,
11,yeah be in four different countries,15:11,,,,
11,during this whole thing see how they're,15:13,,,,
11,dealing with it and,15:14,,,,
11,four different countries where i felt,15:16,,,,
11,you know that my freedom wasn't,15:18,,,,
11,infringed on too much and that you know,15:21,,,,
11,that everyone was doing reasonable stuff,15:23,,,,
11,to,15:25,,,,
11,combat the pandemic while living their,15:27,L,2,,
11,lives and,15:28,,,,
11,a lot of my friends in in some places,15:31,,,,
11,haven't been feeling that way and the,15:33,,,,
11,social pressure has been really bad,15:34,,,,
11,so i don't know north american society i,15:38,,,,
11,decided,15:39,,,,
11,in 2008 actually that i didn't want to,15:42,K,2,,
11,live there anymore there was not a place,15:43,,,,
11,for me i didn't like the direction that,15:44,,,,
11,it was going in terms of uh,15:47,,,,
11,the cultural values and stuff like that,15:49,,,,
11,i needed something more old world and,15:51,,,,
11,more,15:51,,,,
11,um diverse in the way in,15:54,,,,
11,the way people live their lifestyle so i,15:56,,,,
11,found serbia and then later thailand and,15:59,,,,
11,you know other countries like that are,16:01,,,,
11,very good homes to be an expat in,16:03,,,,
11,and even in this time i mean thailand's,16:06,,,,
11,got its borders closed,16:08,,,,
11,i will be there when they open up again,16:11,,,,

11,go back there right now i had a great,16:14,,,,
11,time there,16:15,,,,
11,but the countries that will still open,16:17,J,2,A,2

12,get into that,2:41,,,,
12,you're a digital nomad now living in,2:43,,,,
12,barcelona,2:44,,,,
12,you've been there since february yeah,2:47,,,,
12,it's crazy,2:48,,,,
12,and not like you know that wasn't the,2:50,,,,
12,plan um but because of all this it just,2:53,,,,
12,is a plan now so yeah you were telling,2:55,,,,
12,me that you,2:56,,,,
12,you wanted to travel be in barcelona for,2:58,,,,
12,a few weeks and then you wanted to go to,3:00,,,,
12,lisbon and other parts of europe right,3:03,S,1,C,2
12,exactly yeah like initially,3:05,,,,
12,i kind of had well i really didn't have,3:07,,,,
12,a plan plan um,3:08,,,,
12,i just kind of came i found a really,3:10,,,,
12,good ticket for,3:12,,,,
12,one hundred sixty one from lax,3:15,,,,
12,all the way to barcelona non-stop and,3:18,,,,
12,then um,3:19,,,,
12,yeah the plane was just maybe to be here,3:20,,,,
12,for a little bit i've already been to,3:22,,,,
12,barcelona so i was like yeah i've seen,3:23,,,,
12,it i love it it's a great city,3:25,D,2,,
12,but i also wanted to go to some cities,3:27,,,,
12,that i hadn't been to and then,3:29,,,,
12,you know the world changed like two,3:32,,,,
12,weeks into my stay and i was like okay,3:34,,,,
12,well now i can't go anywhere,3:37,,,,
12,yeah i mean it was just starting when,3:40,,,,
12,like when you when you were on the plane,3:41,,,,
12,i think you you were wiping down,3:43,,,,
12,already wiping down your seats and,3:44,F,3,,
12,everything like that yeah,3:46,,,,
12,and i remember like um because i,3:49,,,,
12,i'm from virginia and so i was in l.a or,3:53,,,,
12,like california,3:54,,,,
12,for like two weeks before i came here i,3:56,,,,
12,remember talking to my family and they,3:58,,,,
12,were like,3:59,,,,
12,this kind of seems like it's going to be,4:00,,,,
12,like a thing like,4:02,,,,
12,do you feel still go to spain and like,4:04,,,,
12,because it's one thing traveling within,4:06,,,,
12,the states within your own country but,4:08,,,,
12,to like,4:08,,,,
12,leave the country and you're not sure,4:09,,,,
12,what's going to happen they're like do,4:10,A,3,,
12,you think it's just still going i'm like,4:12,,,,
12,i'm sure it's going to be fine it seems,4:14,,,,
12,like everything is going to be okay,4:16,,,,
12,you know and then it wasn't yeah,4:19,,,,
12,and then suddenly the world changed and,4:22,,,,
12,fast,4:23,,,,
12,we were both in barcelona at the same,4:25,,,,
12,time,4:26,,,,
12,i think i got back to barcelona march,4:29,,,,
12,twelve,4:30,,,,
12,and i i only spent eight days there,4:33,,,,
12,because they cancelled my flight,4:36,,,,
12,if i didn't rebook by the 21st i would,4:39,,,,
12,have,4:40,S,2,,
12,been i just would have been stuck there,4:42,,,,
12,yeah and,4:44,,,,
12,i mean i'd love to be there yeah be set,4:47,,,,
12,up you know,4:47,,,,
12,like i'm trying to be a digital nomad as,4:50,,,,
12,much as i can,4:53,,,,
12,yeah but i did have to take care of some,4:55,,,,
12,things back home yeah of course,4:57,,,,
12,yeah thankfully i've taken care of stuff,4:59,,,,
12,and i'm just waiting for the travel ban,5:01,,,,
12,to,5:01,,,,
12,get lifted so yeah so us americans can,5:05,,,,
12,travel again,5:06,,,,
12,oh my god i know it's like,5:09,,,,
12,americans can't go anywhere even for me,5:11,,,,
12,it's like i'm here,5:12,,,,
12,so it kind of feels like yes i'm,5:14,,,,
12,i don't,5:17,,,,
12,traveling but at the same time it's like,5:17,,,,
12,i don't think i could leave here you,5:19,,,,
12,know what i mean yeah,5:20,A,2,,
12,yeah and it's a great thing that you're,5:22,,,,
12,in a city that presents,5:24,,,,
12,a lot of different aspects the beach the,5:26,,,,
12,mountains and,5:27,,,,
12,culture and there's just so many things,5:29,,,,
12,coach,5:32,,,,
12,you can see you said you're a blog tech,5:32,,,,
12,what is a blog tech coach like i'm,5:35,,,,
12,trying to figure that out too i'm just,5:37,,,,
12,kidding,5:38,,,,
12,um but no it's basically,5:41,,,,
12,what i found is that there are so many,5:44,,,,
12,people that are so good,5:46,,,,
12,in their specific industries and,5:49,C,3,,
12,most of the people i work with are like,5:51,,,,
12,health coaches or like,5:53,,,,
12,you know people who want to be bloggers,5:55,,,,
12,or offer some kind of service on the,5:57,,,,
12,internet,5:58,,,,
12,and they're good at their zone of genius,6:00,,,,
12,but they don't know how to set that,6:02,,,,
12,process up,6:02,,,,
12,you know what i mean so it's like they,6:04,,,,
12,don't know like how to connect you know,6:06,,,,
12,the domain,6:07,,,,
12,to the hosting or you know what's going,6:09,,,,
12,to be the best platform for them,6:11,,,,
12,but also something that's easy to manage,6:14,,,,
12,because when you're just starting out,6:16,,,,
12,like yeah you can pay like you know five,6:18,A,3,,
12,thousand dollars or something for like a,6:20,,,,
12,really nice website but at the end of,6:21,,,,
12,the day,6:23,,,,
12,are you going to be the one managing it,6:24,,,,
12,or is someone else going to because you,6:26,,,,
12,have to think about those additional,6:27,,,,
12,costs so what i do is i,6:29,,,,
12,you can work with me in one of two ways,6:31,,,,
12,either i can set it up for you,6:33,,,,
12,and then teach you how to do it or,6:36,,,,
12,which is good for people who are just,6:37,,,,
12,starting out or if you already have,6:39,,,,
12,something you just need more like,6:40,,,,
12,consulting then i do that too,6:42,,,,
12,what type of clients do you cater to,6:45,,,,
12,yeah mostly like coaches so like,6:48,,,,
12,health coaches or um,6:52,E,2,,
12,people who want to be bloggers or like a,6:54,,,,
12,virtual assistant,6:55,,,,
12,like people who have services and they,6:57,,,,
12,want to like,6:58,,,,
12,have like a home for them on the,7:00,,,,
12,internet because especially now,7:02,,,,
12,and i think during this time we really,7:04,,,,
12,saw like,7:05,,,,
12,this uptick in people really feeling,7:07,,,,
12,like i need a presence on the internet,7:10,,,,
12,or i need at least,7:11,,,,
12,maybe an extra stream where i can like,7:14,,,,
12,make money on the internet um and i,7:16,,,,
12,think having a home,7:18,,,,
12,where someone can go on there and they,7:21,,,,
12,can purchase,7:22,,,,
12,your service directly from you online,7:25,,,,
12,makes the process so much easier and,7:27,,,,
12,then you can figure out how to work with,7:28,,,,
12,them after that but,7:30,B,2,,
12,to have something set up and you can,7:31,,,,
12,take payments and maybe,7:33,,,,
12,share a little more about yourself and,7:35,,,,
12,what you do and how you add value or,7:37,,,,
12,you know what you offer i think it's a,7:39,,,,
12,great start it can get a little,7:40,,,,
12,confusing for people that are first,7:42,,,,
12,starting off with oh for sure,7:44,,,,
12,yeah there's so many components in terms,7:47,,,,
12,of adding stuff,7:48,,,,
12,uh setting up your uh email,7:52,,,,
12,getting like an email list right that's,7:54,,,,
12,that's one thing that people get,7:55,,,,
12,confused right off the bat,7:57,,,,
12,like how to use mailchimp or any other,7:59,F,3,,
12,program like that right,8:01,,,,
12,yeah and then so what i'm working on now,8:03,,,,
12,is actually building a course,8:05,,,,
12,because something i find that people,8:08,,,,
12,want to know the clients that i have,8:10,,,,
12,is that they want to learn how to manage,8:12,,,,
12,and keep it up on,8:13,,,,
12,their own and then also they come back,8:16,,,,
12,sometimes to ask me like,8:17,,,,
12,a very simple question that i'm thinking,8:20,,,,
12,i need to figure out how to create like,8:22,,,,
12,a community,8:24,,,,
12,where um we can kind of have this,8:26,,,,
12,dialogue,8:27,,,,
12,where it's like this course where you,8:29,,,,
12,know you can have lifetime access and,8:31,,,,
12,you can access me kind of like,8:33,,,,
12,not all the time but like often you know,8:36,,,,
12,to ask these,8:37,,,,
12,questions instead of paying like every,8:39,,,,
12,time you come back for a question or,8:41,,,,
12,something,8:42,,,,
12,yeah yeah you add a nice personal touch,8:45,,,,
12,to it to where,8:46,F,3,,
12,you know you feel like every now and,8:47,,,,
12,then if your client has a question,8:50,,,,
12,yeah they can hit you up and you'll,8:52,,,,
12,personally,8:53,,,,
12,take your time to coach them through it,8:54,,,,
12,basically yeah because honestly that's,8:57,,,,
12,how i got started like,8:58,,,,
12,i started taking like courses and,9:01,,,,
12,coaching programs,9:03,,,,
12,and like they were set up in this way,9:06,,,,
12,where it was like a four-week program,9:08,Q,2,A,1
12,but yet during that time you had access,9:10,,,,
12,to someone,9:11,,,,
12,because there's so many like we were,9:12,,,,
12,talking about moving components of like,9:14,,,,
12,starting a business,9:15,,,,
12,and sometimes you just want to have a,9:17,,,,
12,question and like want to talk to,9:18,,,,
12,someone,9:19,,,,
12,and like so during this live program,9:22,,,,
12,every year,9:22,,,,
12,um i have that access and it's nice,9:25,,,,
12,awesome that's a great business to set,9:28,,,,
12,up and,9:29,,,,
12,look at you now now you're in barcelona,9:31,,,,
12,you know live in the digital,9:33,,,,
12,nomad yeah so the next question is,9:37,,,,
12,how did you end up in barcelona we know,9:39,,,,
12,how you got there with,9:41,,,,
12,uh fly in there and all yeah so,9:43,,,,
12,basically,9:44,,,,
12,i i was in mexico last year for three,9:47,,,,
12,months,9:48,,,,
12,after that i i thought that was going to,9:50,P,1,,
12,be my home right and there were just,9:52,,,,
12,some things that,9:54,,,,
12,just weren't happening the way i wanted,9:55,,,,
12,them to happen,9:57,,,,
12,and so long story short it ended up not,10:00,,,,
12,being a good,10:01,,,,
12,thing at that time but yet when i went,10:04,,,,
12,back home for the holidays like i knew i,10:06,,,,
12,still went to go travel so i was like,10:07,,,,
12,you know maybe,10:08,,,,
12,now's a good time to go back to mexico,10:10,,,,
12,but it's also like high season,10:12,,,,
12,in the beginning of the year and so i,10:14,,,,
12,had a friend,10:15,,,,
12,um that was here and knew barcelona,10:17,,,,
12,really well and,10:18,,,,
12,just ended up coming here um because you,10:20,,,,
12,know the stars align,10:22,,,,
12,the flight was cheap i was like okay,10:24,,,,
12,maybe this is where i need to be,10:25,,,,
12,to your point when you were saying um we,10:28,,,,
12,had a brief conversation earlier when,10:29,,,,
12,you were saying,10:30,,,,
12,you had to come back home and deal with,10:31,,,,
12,something so when i left,10:33,,,,
12,i had the intention of not coming back,10:35,P,1,A,1
12,and so i kind of closed out some things,10:37,,,,
12,set up some things in advance so that,10:41,,,,
12,i knew i wasn't coming back or didn't,10:43,,,,
12,need to come back right away,10:44,,,,
12,once you were you got there you know,10:47,,,,
12,you're probably going to be there for,10:48,,,,
12,what a couple weeks only,10:49,,,,
12,yeah i didn't have a plan to be honest i,10:52,,,,
12,was like i'm just going to,10:53,,,,
12,go and figure it out because my only,10:56,,,,
12,thing that was holding me back from,10:58,,,,
12,being in europe at the beginning of the,10:59,,,,
12,year,11:00,,,,
12,i'm like it's just cold i love europe,11:02,,,,
12,but it's so cold,11:03,,,,
12,in these like winter months you know and,11:06,,,,
12,like it's such a great place to be out,11:08,,,,
12,and walking and i'm like i don't want to,11:09,,,,
12,walk in the cold,11:11,,,,
12,and so um so yeah so i,11:14,,,,
12,was thinking yeah maybe a couple weeks,11:16,N,2,A,2
12,and then maybe go,11:18,,,,
12,someplace else warmer or you know,11:20,,,,
12,something like that and then,11:22,,,,
12,yeah then it got really hard to travel,11:25,,,,
12,exactly then then barcelona locked down,11:28,,,,
12,he came home,11:29,,,,
12,it became home to you yeah yeah and the,11:32,,,,
12,next question would be,11:33,,,,
12,what was it like in barcelona during the,11:35,,,,
12,lockdown oh my god,11:37,,,,
12,okay so i i think at the beginning,11:41,,,,
12,everyone thought it was going to be like,11:43,G,2,H,2
12,this two week thing,11:44,,,,
12,you know because that was kind of what,11:46,,,,
12,we were hearing it's gonna be two weeks,11:47,,,,
12,i'm like okay you know,11:48,,,,
12,tweaks being locked down yes not ideal,11:52,,,,
12,but you know it'll be okay,11:55,,,,
12,and then it started to extend and so i,11:58,,,,
12,so when i first came to barcelona i only,12:00,,,,
12,knew one person,12:02,,,,
12,um he actually lives outside of the city,12:03,,,,
12,it was someone i met when i was here,12:06,,,,
12,several years ago i came with a travel,12:08,,,,
12,company and he was like our tour guide,12:10,A,1,,
12,but now he like has a job he has like a,12:12,,,,
12,whole life you know,12:13,,,,
12,he was the only person i knew and then i,12:14,,,,
12,met you on the plane you guys are the,12:16,,,,
12,only two people,12:19,,,,
12,that's funny because we even rode into,12:21,,,,
12,the city together at,12:22,,,,
12,the arrow mess too you were like out,12:24,,,,
12,you're like you should do this you,12:26,,,,
12,should do that i was like oh my god,12:27,,,,
12,thank you,12:29,,,,
12,um and then when i was here a friend of,12:32,G,1,,
12,mine that i met in mexico,12:33,,,,
12,connected me with a friend of hers who,12:35,,,,
12,just happened to be he's from new york,12:37,,,,
12,he just happened to be here too so it,12:39,,,,
12,was kind of nice,12:41,,,,
12,at the beginning of feeling like okay i,12:42,,,,
12,know a couple people so if i,12:44,,,,
12,am if this turns out to be a real thing,12:46,,,,
12,it won't be that intense,12:48,,,,
12,but um during the lockdown yeah i was in,12:51,,,,
12,an apartment by myself for like two and,12:52,,,,
12,a half months,12:54,,,,
12,and it was kind of crazy because,12:58,,,,
12,it was kind of like i don't want to say,13:00,,,,
12,extreme,13:01,,,,
12,but like it was we have one of you this,13:04,,,,
12,rules,13:05,,,,
12,in like the i feel like in the world,13:07,,,,
12,maybe like china,13:08,,,,
12,too but like it was pretty strict here,13:11,,,,
12,and so,13:12,,,,
12,it was kind of i think initially it was,13:14,,,,
12,like okay i'm going to use this time to,13:16,,,,
12,relax,13:16,D,2,,
12,kind of get some things in order that,13:19,,,,
12,i've been saying i want to get an order,13:20,,,,
12,because now i don't have any,13:21,,,,
12,distractions,13:22,,,,
12,like i can't leave i'm like stuck in,13:24,,,,
12,this house,13:25,,,,
12,luckily it's like a big house and,13:27,,,,
12,there's like lots of room i think if i,13:28,,,,
12,was in a smaller place i probably would,13:30,,,,
12,have gone crazy,13:31,,,,
12,but yeah it was just weird not being,13:33,,,,
12,able to go outside,13:35,,,,
12,you know what i mean yeah i mean it was,13:37,,,,
12,up to a 600 euro fine,13:39,,,,
12,if uh you were caught way too far,13:42,,,,
12,outside of your,13:43,,,,
12,your neighborhood and you basically,13:46,O,2,,
12,you basically were only able to go to,13:48,,,,
12,the grocery store and the pharmacy,13:50,,,,
12,exactly or the hospital if something was,13:53,,,,
12,wrong but yeah,13:54,,,,
12,like we weren't able to go anywhere and,13:56,,,,
12,it was like i think,13:58,,,,
12,and then this other part of it was,14:00,,,,
12,everyone,14:02,,,,
12,was transitioned into working from home,14:04,,,,
12,and everyone was oh my god i hate,14:05,,,,
12,working from home i hate the computer,14:08,,,,
12,and then you know after a while was kind,14:09,,,,
12,of like uh i just need like a different,14:11,,,,
12,scenery you know,14:13,,,,
12,but yeah it was it was strange for sure,14:15,,,,
12,because it's like i had never,14:17,Q,2,F,3
12,been locked down i don't think anybody,14:20,,,,
12,has like,14:21,,,,
12,locked down like to that extent you know,14:24,,,,
12,it was like intense yeah and i guess you,14:26,,,,
12,had to look at it,14:27,,,,
12,with a silver lining that you were,14:29,,,,
12,actually able to get your,14:30,,,,
12,work done because it really didn't have,14:33,,,,
12,distractions,14:35,,,,
12,yes that is a silver lining because it's,14:37,,,,
12,like i was able to set up a couple of,14:39,,,,
12,things,14:39,,,,
12,i was still working with a couple people,14:41,,,,
12,actually during that time,14:43,,,,
12,um although some clients did skill like,14:46,,,,
12,there were some people i was supposed to,14:47,A,3,F,3
12,work with and didn't end up working with,14:48,,,,
12,them,14:49,,,,
12,because i guess like budgets or or,14:51,,,,
12,whatever they had going,14:52,,,,
12,on there and luckily i was still able to,14:54,,,,
12,do a couple things,14:55,,,,
12,being in here and being focused and then,14:57,,,,
12,it also gave me some time to kind of,14:59,,,,
12,work on or figure out my own projects,15:01,,,,
12,because sometimes,15:02,,,,
12,like when you're up with clients you're,15:03,,,,
12,like so focused on their stuff and then,15:05,D,2,,
12,you have to update your stuff too,15:07,,,,
12,so sometimes your stuff gets pushed on,15:08,,,,
12,stuff that's,15:10,,,,
12,the back burner because you're doing the,15:10,,,,
12,making you the money which is like,15:12,,,,
12,working with them exactly sometimes,15:14,,,,
12,working with clients,15:15,,,,
12,that has to be the priority because,15:17,,,,
12,that's where your income comes from,15:19,,,,
12,yeah of course i'm guessing you got to,15:21,,,,
12,catch up on a lot of netflix or,15:23,,,,
12,something similar right you know what i,15:26,,,,
12,actually don't watch,15:27,,,,
12,tv really um i know i'm more of like,15:30,,,,
12,so i listened to i started listening to,15:32,S,3,,
12,this like podcast,15:34,,,,
12,kind of like on youtube this woman,15:37,,,,
12,speaks about like life,15:38,,,,
12,it was such a good time actually to,15:40,,,,
12,really be,15:42,,,,
12,like think about your life and think,15:44,,,,
12,about like what it is that you want in,15:46,,,,
12,life and like just kind of get your mind,15:48,,,,
12,right and so i used that time for that,15:50,A,3,,
12,but i did watch a couple of things on,15:51,,,,
12,netflix i watched um,15:53,,,,
12,i'm more like documentaries so i watched,15:55,,,,
12,a couple of those i watched i hadn't,15:57,,,,
12,watched a secret,15:58,,,,
12,have you heard of the secret i've heard,16:00,,,,
12,of it yeah,16:01,,,,
12,i lost netflix in the middle of the,16:03,,,,
12,pandemic and i just uh,16:05,,,,
12,i just haven't been uh i've been too,16:07,,,,
12,cheap to,16:08,,,,
12,be uploaded yeah i i hear you i only,16:12,,,,
12,have it here this isn't even mine but,16:14,,,,
12,it's here in this airbnb,16:16,,,,
12,um so yeah i watched the secret i,16:19,,,,
12,watched,16:20,,,,
12,like a series the girl boss nice,16:23,,,,
12,and like you know a couple of things,16:24,E,2,,
12,like that but yeah what happened to the,16:27,,,,
12,90-day tourist visa when you were,16:29,,,,
12,only,16:32,,,,
12,when the lockdown was implemented you're,16:32,,,,
12,supposed to be there for 90 days right,16:34,,,,
12,so unless you leave and,16:36,C,3,,
12,go back no i'm kidding i'm not illegal,16:40,,,,
12,but you know it's still kind of tricky,16:42,,,,
12,because,16:44,,,,
12,there are different things being said,16:46,,,,
12,but for the most part basically what,16:48,,,,
12,happened was that,16:49,,,,
12,they put a freeze on like the dates for,16:52,,,,
12,like anything,16:53,,,,
12,because all the offices were closed and,16:56,,,,
12,so for the tourist visa,16:58,,,,
12,they said you know once the state of,17:00,,,,
12,alarm ends,17:01,,,,
12,we'll start counting the days from then,17:04,K,1,,
12,right,17:05,,,,
12,so reset the 90 right yeah exactly so,17:08,,,,
12,like once the state of alarm lifted,17:10,,,,
12,those dates reset to 90. so the state of,17:13,,,,
12,alarm lifted,17:14,,,,
12,today is august 4th it lifted on um,17:19,,,,
12,i think june 21st so technically you,17:22,,,,
12,have 90 days from that day,17:23,,,,
12,i mean i knew they were starting to get,17:24,,,,
12,back to life there but i didn't realize,17:26,,,,
12,already,17:28,,,,
12,that they lifted the state of alarm,17:28,,,,
12,yeah it was lifted i'm pretty sure i,17:30,,,,
12,don't think it was july i'm pretty sure,17:32,,,,
12,it's june,17:32,,,,
12,if i were able to stay there i'd,17:35,,,,
12,possibly be like you right now,17:36,,,,
12,just yeah not leave barcelona exactly,17:39,L,2,,
12,because i'm thinking god i came here in,17:41,,,,
12,february,17:42,,,,
12,that's like this is the longest time,17:43,,,,
12,i've ever been like in any one,17:46,,,,
12,place consistently like this you know,17:48,,,,
12,yeah but it's just,17:50,,,,
12,a different type of staying at one place,17:52,,,,
12,right,17:53,,,,
12,yeah definitely three months locked down,17:55,,,,
12,is not,17:57,,,,
12,the way you want it yeah right but the,17:59,,,,
12,beauty of being here,18:00,,,,
12,during this time is that there are a lot,18:03,,,,
12,less,18:04,L,2,,
12,people here so it's like you really got,18:06,,,,
12,to,18:07,,,,
12,i don't want to say you really have to,18:08,,,,
12,experience it but like in a different,18:11,,,,
12,way,18:11,,,,
12,you know what i mean because when i,18:13,,,,
12,first came it was just like a normal,18:15,,,,
12,time so it was like super crowded,18:17,,,,
12,granted it was february but there's,18:19,,,,
12,still it just felt like the city had,18:20,,,,
12,more likes,18:21,,,,
12,you know but like after that and like,18:24,,,,
12,the lockdown and then after the lockdown,18:26,,,,
12,it was just so weird because so even,18:29,,,,
12,near,18:29,,,,
12,um right here,18:32,,,,
12,near me like it was just so,18:35,,,,
12,bare i was like i've never seen,18:39,,,,
12,this like this like it was crazy,18:41,,,,
12,barcelona without the tourists,18:42,,,,
12,and the locals weren't really able to go,18:45,,,,
12,out of their house,18:46,,,,
12,and then i think there was a time also,18:48,,,,
12,when people were like,18:50,,,,
12,scared you know like they just weren't,18:52,,,,
12,what to expect,18:54,,,,
12,so then people just weren't going out,18:55,,,,
12,outside unless,18:57,,,,
12,they had to you know yeah it was like,18:59,,,,
12,the middle of march,19:01,,,,
12,till probably april all of april that's,19:03,,,,
12,probably,19:04,,,,
12,the time where people were still trying,19:05,,,,
12,to figure this whole thing out,19:07,,,,
12,what is life like in barcelona as a,19:10,,,,
12,digital nomad so you know how i said i,19:12,,,,
12,came here,19:13,,,,
12,and i met well i knew you on the plane,19:17,,,,
12,and then another person everyone else,19:20,,,,
12,that i've met,19:21,,,,
12,awesome,19:24,,,,
12,has been through the internet that's,19:24,K,2,L,3
12,but we are here so yeah it's been,19:27,,,,
12,amazing what i love about it,19:29,,,,
12,this city for the most part is like i,19:30,,,,
12,feel like in most cities where it's like,19:32,,,,
12,it has a digital nomad vibe it's very,19:34,,,,
12,transient so people are,19:36,,,,
12,in and out really quick but here it's,19:38,,,,
12,more of like somewhere in between the,19:40,,,,
12,general nomad and expat,19:41,,,,
12,because it's like even though people,19:43,,,,
12,have this work online thing,19:44,,,,
12,they're here a little longer so then you,19:47,,,,
12,really get to cultivate those like,19:48,,,,
12,relationships you get to like i don't,19:51,,,,
12,know really get to know people instead,19:53,,,,
12,of it being more like an,19:54,,,,
12,in and out kind of vibe you know what i,19:56,,,,
12,mean which i kind of like,19:58,,,,
12,and so yeah it's great because there are,20:00,,,,
12,so many,20:02,,,,
12,in normal times before this like i was,20:04,,,,
12,going to like events,20:05,,,,
12,and stuff yeah it was like international,20:08,D,2,,
12,women's day,20:08,,,,
12,i think like right before this happened,20:10,,,,
12,and i would have,20:12,,,,
12,met a ton of people like it was great,20:15,,,,
12,um so it's definitely a good place to be,20:17,,,,
12,if you,20:18,,,,
12,have a business online and you're,20:20,,,,
12,looking to meet with other like expats,20:21,,,,
12,or digital nomads like,20:23,,,,
12,this is a great place and then you get,20:24,,,,
12,to meet people from all over the world,20:26,,,,
12,yeah it's it's really is a nice hub for,20:30,,,,
12,for digital nomads and also for,20:33,,,,
12,working at different places like cafes,20:35,,,,
12,which leads us into the next question,20:37,S,3,,
12,yeah what are your favorite cafes in,20:40,,,,
12,barcelona,20:42,,,,
12,okay so you i kind of like working out,20:44,,,,
12,of hotels,20:47,,,,
12,in the lobbies in some hotels here,20:50,,,,
12,like some of the lobbies have it set up,20:53,,,,
12,like uh,20:53,,,,
12,like a co-working space you know so you,20:56,,,,
12,can just like get a coffee,20:57,A,3,,
12,and just kind of sit there like a cafe,21:00,,,,
12,as well,21:01,,,,
12,so um like before this i would meet up,21:04,,,,
12,with a friend that there's a hotel,21:07,,,,
12,just on the other side of diagonal like,21:09,,,,
12,not too far from where i live,21:11,,,,
12,um it was hotel 70 have you been there,21:15,,,,
12,hotel 70 no i don't think i have there's,21:17,A,2,,
12,so many hotels it's crazy,21:19,,,,
12,and it's nice that they kind of cater,21:22,,,,
12,which goes back to your plane of being,21:23,,,,
12,like a digital nomads city they kind of,21:25,,,,
12,cater to this audience because they,21:27,,,,
12,they have some tables that are like,21:30,,,,
12,there for you with like,21:31,,,,
12,plugs where you can go in there and sit,21:33,,,,
12,and work and just order like a coffee or,21:35,,,,
12,like a tea,21:36,,,,
12,or something like that so there are a,21:37,,,,
12,couple of those in the city but then,21:39,,,,
12,there's,21:39,,,,
12,it's called like,21:42,,,,
12,one that's not too far from me i think,21:42,,,,
12,eat my trip yeah it's so good,21:47,C,3,,
12,they have it's like such a cute little,21:49,,,,
12,vibe in there,21:50,,,,
12,um they have like really good coffee,21:52,,,,
12,really good brunch,21:53,,,,
12,they have the best smoothies like if you,21:56,,,,
12,ever want to go get a smoothie it's,21:58,,,,
12,nice juice dudes it's good too i like,22:00,,,,
12,juice dudes,22:02,,,,
12,um but yeah and then i think in terms of,22:05,,,,
12,like,22:06,,,,
12,like going,22:09,,,,
12,other cafes or like neighborhoods like i,22:09,,,,

12,a lot of cafes in the champlain,22:18,,,,
12,sometimes i'm so spoiled like i'd never,22:19,,,,

12,well guys we'll see you in the next,28:14:00,,,,
12,video adios,28:17:00,,,,
13,over the last 12 years I've gone from,0:01,A,1,,
13,being a casual traveler to very quickly,0:04,,,,
13,being a frequent traveler to being a,0:06,,,,
13,full-time Nomad and now to slowly but,0:09,,,,
13,surely selling into somewhat of a,0:11,,,,
13,routine in this video I'm going to talk,0:14,,,,
13,about the benefits of slow travel,0:19,,,,
13,hi I'm Andrew Henderson this has been a,0:35,F,3,,
13,transition for me over all my years of,0:37,,,,
13,developing what is now the nomad,0:40,,,,
13,capitalists lifestyle and at first I can,0:43,,,,
13,tell you it was fascinating to be in a,0:46,K,2,,
13,different City,0:47,,,,
13,every week every 10 days even every,0:50,,,,
13,month that is the fast travel that a lot,0:53,,,,
13,of people who first get into a nomadic,0:55,,,,
13,lifestyle or who want to explore do I,0:59,,,,
13,remember back in 2013 I set aside a year,1:02,C,2,,
13,and I started in Asia and I set aside a,1:05,,,,
13,month to be in each different country,1:08,,,,
13,because I wanted to move quickly through,1:10,,,,
13,each of the different countries and see,1:12,,,,
13,as many opportunities maybe as many,1:13,,,,
13,people as possible but what I've learned,1:16,,,,
13,since then and what I've learned from,1:19,N,2,,
13,meeting a lot of people who are,1:20,,,,
13,successful entrepreneurs as well is that,1:23,,,,
13,there are benefits to slow travel you,1:26,,,,
13,see back a couple years ago I remembeR,1:28,K,2,,
13,landing in Belgrade I checked into my,1:31,,,,
13,hotel and I went out for a walk I've,1:34,,,,
13,taken so many times from that hotel out,1:37,,,,
13,the front door TURN RIGHT thinking to,1:39,,,,
13,myself I love being in Belgrade if only,1:44,,,,
13,I could be here for like 10 days and,1:45,,,,
13,then go into the next place that would,1:47,,,,
13,be so great there's a certain lack of,1:51,A,3,,
13,commitment or fear of commitment that I,1:53,,,,
13,think a lot of us have dealt with at,1:54,,,,
13,various times in our Nomad journey,1:56,,,,
13,because it feels comfortable the same,1:58,,,,
13,way fear of commitment feels comfortable,2:00,,,,
13,for four people and especially for men,2:03,,,,
13,in in a lot of areas of of life here's,2:08,,,,
13,what I've learned about slow travel as,2:10,N,2,,
13,Nomad capitalist has grown as I've had,2:13,,,,
13,the chance to meet more more successful,2:15,,,,
13,people who are doing this and who have,2:17,,,,
13,come to me for help,2:18,,,,
13,what I find is that I can generally make,2:23,,,,
13,a graph that the wealthier you are the,2:25,,,,
13,slower your travel is the Oubre wealthy,2:28,,,,
13,people who come to me say Andrew I just,2:30,J,1,,
13,want to find one place to go maybe I'll,2:32,,,,
13,take a vacation every once in a while,2:34,,,,
13,but find me one place that's tax,2:36,,,,
13,friendly where I can live my life in,2:38,,,,
13,peace and just enjoy myself the people,2:42,,,,
13,who are the more active entrepreneurs,2:43,,,,
13,but who are still really sick,2:44,,,,
13,the seven-figure entrepreneurs for,2:46,,,,
13,exactly maybe they want to have you know,2:48,,,,
13,two bases maybe they even want to try,2:51,,,,
13,that trifecta you know I like to a,2:53,,,,
13,trifecta excited I just can't sit still,2:55,,,,
13,but the more I experienced it the more I,2:58,N,2,,
13,just want to stay in one place for a,3:00,,,,
13,longer period of time when you get into,3:02,,,,
13,more than six six-figure entrepreneurs,3:04,Q,2,,
13,they like the three bases the four bases,3:06,,,,
13,maybe they want to you know stay two,3:07,,,,
13,months in one place and then go on they,3:09,,,,
13,still like maybe some of the the,3:10,,,,
13,trappings of the year BM B's or not,3:12,,,,
13,having a home or maybe they want to have,3:13,,,,
13,a base spend two three four months there,3:16,,,,
13,and then travel around from there at,3:18,,,,
13,varying paces the reason and I think,3:21,,,,
13,what people have told me why they like,3:24,D,1,,
13,slow travel is that they get a lot more,3:26,,,,
13,done I remember we had a meeting we had,3:30,A,2,,
13,about 15 or 20 of us in a boardroom,3:32,,,,
13,about five years ago and one of the guys,3:35,,,,
13,who was in the meeting said for all of,3:39,,,,
13,you who are just starting out you're,3:40,,,,
13,gonna eventually realize that you know,3:43,,,,
13,traipsing your way through Southeast,3:45,,,,
13,Asia and you know Columbia and and,3:47,,,,
13,Central America is gonna work to get to,3:49,,,,
13,a certain point but it's not gonna get,3:51,C,3,,
13,you to the 50 million dollar business,3:53,,,,
13,those words really ring true to me now,3:57,,,,
13,more than ever because the more,3:59,,,,
13,successful your business becomes the,4:01,,,,
13,more you need to rely on systems and,4:03,,,,
13,processes the more potentially you need,4:05,,,,
13,to hire someone who has some Western,4:06,D,3,,
13,experience and you're not just gonna get,4:07,,,,
13,by you know hiring Filipinos or you know,4:10,,,,
13,Serbians or Venezuelans you know you,4:12,,,,
13,want someone who has your your formative,4:14,,,,
13,experience you know you need more of,4:15,,,,
13,those trappings of the world that you,4:17,,,,
13,left now I'm not saying go back to the,4:20,,,,
13,world that you left I'm standing by go,4:21,,,,
13,where you're treated best but what I,4:22,,,,
13,have found is that the slower you travel,4:25,N,1,,
13,the more you can get done the more you,4:27,,,,
13,can focus that's a progression that you,4:29,,,,
13,know as I've grown I've really picked up,4:32,,,,
13,on and I think that's been very,4:35,,,,
13,important for me I think that also as we,4:38,,,,
13,get little bit older we just want to do,4:40,,,,
13,a little bit less and for me dealing,4:43,,,,
13,with the hotels thing with the planes,4:44,,,,
13,dealing with the delays dealing with,4:46,,,,
13,everything you know always you know,4:48,,,,
13,changing it becomes less interesting to,4:49,,,,
13,me as I've become more more successful,4:51,,,,
13,to become older as I you know prepare to,4:54,,,,
13,have a family and I look to the future I,4:57,,,,
13,think that the most,4:58,,,,
13,for people who are living this nomadic,5:00,A,2,,
13,capitalist lifestyle or the ones who are,5:01,,,,
13,looking far ahead because they're the,5:03,,,,
13,ones who are willing to do what it takes,5:04,,,,
13,now to build the life that they want for,5:08,,,,
13,the rest of their lives the people who,5:09,,,,
13,are willing to to invest what it takes,5:11,,,,
13,now to save millions of dollars of tax,5:13,,,,
13,for the rest of their lives and to put,5:15,,,,
13,the infrastructure in place because,5:17,,,,
13,they're looking forward and I think that,5:19,,,,
13,those people have a tendency to to be a,5:21,N,2,,
13,bit more slow and a bit more methodical,5:23,,,,
13,in the way that they go about life but,5:25,,,,
13,but just as importantly when it comes to,5:27,,,,
13,slow travel what I find a lot of people,5:30,,,,
13,who travel very quickly you know the,5:33,,,,
13,Instagram influencers for example they I,5:35,C,2,,
13,believe we're missing a lot of the,5:37,,,,
13,opportunities in a place for me because,5:40,,,,
13,I'm 24/7 and because this is my hobby I,5:44,,,,
13,was able to get a lot done on the ground,5:46,,,,
13,in one month in the country but I could,5:48,,,,
13,have gotten a lot more done being on the,5:50,,,,
13,ground for 3 months and if you're moving,5:52,,,,
13,it a bit more leisurely pace and you're,5:54,,,,
13,taking time to go to the pool and go to,5:55,H,1,,
13,the beach and hang out then I think,5:58,,,,
13,maybe even more time is needed because,6:00,,,,
13,what people are missing when they're,6:01,,,,
13,traveling so quickly is all the,6:03,,,,
13,opportunities what I've been able to do,6:05,K,2,C,2
13,by spending repeatedly going back to,6:07,,,,
13,some of the same places is building a,6:09,,,,
13,deep network I stopped at some point,6:11,,,,
13,building wide and I started building,6:12,,,,
13,deeper and deeper to truly understand,6:15,,,,
13,here's exactly how to invest in this,6:16,,,,
13,country here's exactly what not to do,6:18,,,,
13,here's the real opportunity here I want,6:21,,,,
13,you to see the opportunities and I would,6:23,,,,
13,posit that slower travel may be a way,6:26,,,,
13,for you to see more opportunities that,6:28,C,2,Q,2
13,are deeper rather than wider one of the,6:31,,,,
13,challenges that I've had is I'm,6:32,,,,
13,intrigued by everything for a long time,6:35,,,,
13,I haven't really been that interested in,6:36,C,3,N,3
13,Latin America but now I'm back,6:37,,,,
13,interested in Latin America and so now,6:39,,,,
13,I'm I'm somewhat dividing my time it's,6:41,,,,
13,the point where I've now built at a team,6:43,,,,
13,of a dozen or so people and some of,6:45,,,,
13,those people all they do is research I'm,6:46,,,,
13,putting them on a plane for a change,6:48,,,,
13,because I can't do it all I can't live,6:51,N,2,L,2
13,the life that I want because I'm still,6:53,,,,
13,not slow enough I need people who are,6:56,,,,
13,based in one place to get in a plane and,6:58,,,,
13,go all around the world and figure this,7:00,,,,
13,stuff out for me because depth is,7:02,,,,
13,important and I think depth comes with a,7:05,,,,
13,certain amount of slowness but lastly,7:08,,,,
13,what I hear from people is slowing down,7:10,,,,
13,I think a lot of times increases the,7:11,,,,
13,quality of,7:12,,,,
13,if you just get to relax one thing that,7:14,A,2,Q,2
13,I've started doing with my trifecta,7:16,,,,
13,approach is four months in Asia four,7:18,,,,
13,months in Europe for months in Latin,7:20,,,,
13,America and you could change those give,7:22,,,,
13,me five four three or any combination,7:25,,,,
13,thereof,7:25,,,,
13,but what I found is I'm going to,7:28,Q,3,J,3
13,establish a home in each of those,7:30,,,,
13,trifecta places and if I'm in Montenegro,7:32,,,,
13,for the summer and I want to go to,7:34,,,,
13,Bosnia to do something I'm going into,7:37,,,,
13,summer I'm not flying from Mexico City,7:38,,,,
13,to Bosnia I'm going into car from,7:42,,,,
13,Montenegro you know this is my time to,7:44,Q,2,J,2
13,go in and do work in Belgrade or look at,7:48,,,,
13,that property that I want to buy in,7:49,,,,
13,Belgrade and by doing that I've somewhat,7:53,,,,
13,pigeon-holed myself into there are,7:55,,,,
13,certain times to do certain kind of work,7:57,,,,
13,stuff done,7:59,,,,
13,the slowness forces me to get certain,7:59,,,,
13,it forces me to prioritize certain,8:01,C,3,,
13,things and it has increased the quality,8:03,,,,
13,of life because I'm not flying from,8:05,,,,
13,Mexico City to Bosnia or from you know,8:08,,,,
13,Kuala Lumpur - you know Tajikistan,8:10,,,,
13,I'm staying within my range and I'm,8:13,,,,
13,building up my team to help me so I want,8:15,L,2,N,2
13,to hear what you think about this,8:17,,,,
13,because there's this is an area that I'm,8:18,,,,
13,really focused on I'm continuing to to,8:20,,,,
13,develop because so many people who are,8:24,,,,
13,high earners are getting into wanting to,8:27,,,,
13,become Nomad capitalists and because so,8:29,,,,
13,many high earners like the idea of,8:31,,,,
13,slowing down a little bit it's a very,8:33,,,,
13,intriguing concept to me I'd love for,8:34,,,,
13,you to leave a comment I want to know,8:36,,,,
13,what your opinion is about this are you,8:38,N,1,,
13,travelling slow are you travelling fast,8:39,,,,
13,what would you if you're not doing,8:41,,,,
13,either of the above you know what would,8:42,,,,
13,you want to be doing what are the,8:43,,,,
13,benefits of slow versus fast in your,8:46,,,,
13,opinion leave a comment below if you'd,8:49,,,,
13,like us to talk more about this topic of,8:52,,,,
13,slow travel hi I'm Andrew Henderson from,8:55,F,3,,
13,nomad capitalists I wrote this book,8:57,,,,
13,which you can find on Amazon to distill,9:00,,,,
13,a lot of the stuff we talked about in,9:02,,,,
13,these videos and a lot of the stuff I've,9:04,,,,
13,learned over the last decade plus,9:05,,,,
13,traveling all around the world teaching,9:08,K,2,A,2
13,you about how to legally reduce your,9:09,,,,
13,taxes build your personal freedom and,9:11,,,,
13,create wealth faster definitely get a,9:14,,,,
13,copy of this book if you want to learn,9:16,D,1,,
13,more now if you want to watch more,9:18,,,,
13,videos make sure you subscribe to our,9:20,F,3,,

13,treated best and if you're already a six,9:30,,,,
13,or seven figure entrepreneur and you'd,9:32,,,,
13,like to put these strategies in place,9:33,F,3,,
13,for yourself go to Nomad capitalists,9:36,,,,
13,comm and learn about how I can help you,9:37,,,,
14,hi everybody this is alia Martin from,0:01,G,2,,
14,running remote and in today's video,0:03,,,,
14,we're gonna be talking about something,0:04,,,,
14,that's relatively serious I think that,0:08,,,,
14,it's something that I started to see on,0:10,,,,
14,social media quite a bit and I don't,0:13,,,,
14,really like it and I'm trying to reach,0:16,,,,
14,out to a bunch of digital Nomad people,0:20,,,,
14,or location-independent people and,0:23,,,,
14,really kind of explain to them what the,0:26,,,,
14,current situation is with kovat 19 and,0:28,,,,
14,how they could be unknowingly adding,0:31,,,,
14,into this negative trend stay tuned,0:36,G,3,,
14,alright so covin 19 for those of you,0:37,,,,
14,that don't know it is a virus it is a,0:40,,,,
14,virus that has basically now turned into,0:42,,,,
14,a pandemic it's pretty much on every,0:44,,,,
14,continent on planet Earth pretty much in,0:46,,,,
14,every country on planet Earth I think,0:48,,,,
14,Africa should be filled in pretty soon,0:50,,,,
14,and or they don't have the right testing,0:51,,,,
14,kits to actually test their population,0:54,,,,
14,properly there are thousands of deaths,0:58,,,,
14,and there are probably going to be,0:59,,,,
14,significantly more unfortunately we are,1:02,,,,
14,past the point of containment and now,1:05,,,,
14,we're in what's called a state of,1:07,,,,
14,mitigation where we want to be able to,1:09,,,,
14,make sure that as few people as humanly,1:12,,,,
14,possible get this over an extended,1:14,,,,
14,amount of time in order to make sure,1:17,E,1,A,2
14,that the medical system can actually,1:20,,,,
14,absorb those people and we can have,1:24,,,,
14,everyone have access to a ventilator or,1:27,,,,
14,to provide a professional medical care,1:29,,,,
14,in order to reduce the amount of deaths,1:32,,,,
14,that are going to occur now I've seen on,1:36,,,,
14,social media a lot of people that are,1:38,,,,
14,just posting hey are you guys still,1:39,,,,
14,traveling due to coronavirus and digital,1:42,,,,
14,nomads kind of chat groups Facebook,1:44,,,,
14,groups that kind of stuff and it's blown,1:47,,,,
14,me away that the vast majority of people,1:49,,,,
14,are saying oh yeah I'm still gonna go,1:50,,,,
14,I'm gonna get cheaper deals on travel,1:52,,,,
14,I'm gonna be able to really explore the,1:56,,,,
14,world and of course I'm Way too young so,1:59,J,2,B,1
14,it's not going to affect me that much,2:01,,,,
14,and you're absolutely right it will,2:04,,,,
14,probably not affect you people below the,2:06,,,,
14,age of 39,2:07,,,,
14,a point two percent chance of dying from,2:11,,,,
14,covin 19 however people that are in the,2:15,,,,
14,80 plus category have I believe a 14,2:18,,,,
14,point 8 percent chance currently of,2:19,,,,
14,dying from kovat 19 and this is the core,2:24,,,,
14,piece that I really want to touch on,2:26,,,,
14,right now yes you're not gonna die from,2:28,,,,
14,the corona virus if your digital nomad,2:31,,,,
14,however you could be putting other,2:33,,,,
14,people at risk so if you get infected,2:35,,,,
14,with the virus you're not just a regular,2:38,,,,
14,person you're someone that travels and,2:40,,,,
14,interacts with large groups of people or,2:42,,,,
14,you're in a hostile situation where,2:46,,,,
14,you're interacting with a lot of people,2:48,,,,
14,maybe you're six people to a room you're,2:50,,,,
14,going to spread the virus to many more,2:53,,,,
14,people and when you think to yourself,2:55,,,,
14,well everyone that I'm spreading the,2:57,,,,
14,virus to is young as well yes probably,3:01,,,,
14,however here's the big problem,3:04,,,,
14,exponential spread is serious,3:07,,,,
14,so if ten people have it today and 20,3:11,,,,
14,people have it in three days and 40,3:14,,,,
14,people have it in three days later 80,3:16,,,,
14,people 160 320 we're going to have an,3:21,,,,
14,exponential scale that is this is,3:23,,,,
14,currently what we are experiencing and,3:25,,,,
14,even though you're right you will,3:28,,,,
14,probably survive this virus every person,3:31,,,,
14,that is not infected by this virus means,3:36,,,,
14,we'll be able to reduce that exponential,3:39,,,,
14,spread that exponential curve so you,3:42,,,,
14,won't get you won't die from it but your,3:45,,,,
14,grandmother might die from it and by you,3:47,,,,
14,doing these types of things traveling to,3:50,E,1,A,1
14,these other countries interacting with,3:52,,,,
14,all these other people you're going to,3:54,,,,
14,actually get more people infected those,3:57,,,,
14,people are going to go interact with,3:59,,,,
14,other people in the public and we're,4:01,,,,
14,going to create a situation in which,4:02,,,,
14,people that are at risk that may not be,4:05,,,,
14,in the hostel or may not be in the cool,4:09,,,,
14,Changu hangout spot the CrossFit gym as,4:12,,,,
14,an example are going to end up getting,4:15,,,,
14,it and they're going to end up,4:16,,,,
14,dying from it it's 14.8% mortality rate,4:20,,,,
14,for people over the age of 80 this is,4:22,,,,
14,very very serious and this is something,4:25,,,,
14,that yes there are about right now a,4:28,Q,1,A,2
14,hundred thousand ish cases but I fully,4:32,,,,
14,expect to be it to us to be in the,4:34,,,,
14,millions within the next month or two,4:36,,,,
14,and if this has not stopped in the tens,4:39,,,,
14,of millions literally the next month so,4:42,,,,
14,this is not something that should be,4:44,,,,
14,taken with a grain of salt this is,4:47,,,,
14,something that's really really serious,4:50,,,,
14,and by you doing that you are adding,4:53,,,,
14,into this problem I have personally,4:56,,,,
14,restricted all travel not because I,4:59,,,,
14,don't think that I'll have a problem if,5:01,,,,
14,I survive this virus I will be okay if I,5:04,,,,
14,survive this virus the chance of me,5:06,,,,
14,dying is very small however the chance,5:08,,,,
14,of me passing it on to older friends and,5:11,,,,
14,family is significant significantly high,5:15,,,,
14,and that's the issue that I want to,5:18,,,,
14,address with you guys right now if you,5:20,,,,
14,are currently traveling internationally,5:21,,,,
14,you are part of the problem you are not,5:25,,,,
14,part of the solution you need to be able,5:27,,,,
14,to take this time off go back to your,5:30,,,,
14,home country and prepare to get through,5:33,,,,
14,this and help the other people that are,5:36,,,,
14,around you also if you won't pay,5:38,,,,
14,attention to that argument we've seen a,5:40,,,,
14,few countries now completely shut down,5:42,T,2,A,1
14,their borders and I fully expect the,5:45,,,,
14,vast majority of air travel to probably,5:48,,,,
14,not be functional within the next few,5:51,,,,
14,weeks to months this is something again,5:54,,,,
14,that a lot of the media is not really,5:57,,,,
14,reporting on because they're not taking,5:59,,,,
14,it as seriously as you should take it at,6:01,,,,
14,a three point four percent average,6:04,,,,
14,mortality rate which is the average,6:06,,,,
14,mortality rate that we currently are,6:09,,,,
14,seeing that the w-h-o has provided to us,6:11,,,,
14,if a billion people get this what do you,6:14,,,,
14,think the death rate from that is going,6:16,,,,
14,to be it is going to be tens of millions,6:19,,,,
14,of people we are going to overload our,6:22,,,,
14,medical systems we are going to overload,6:24,,,,
14,our food trip and transportation,6:28,G,2,,
14,infrastructure this is some,6:29,,,,
14,that's absolutely serious in digital,6:31,,,,
14,nomads and location independent,6:33,,,,
14,individuals that are traveling around,6:35,,,,
14,and helping to spread this virus again,6:38,,,,
14,are part of that problem but if you're,6:40,,,,
14,not gonna pay attention to that you need,6:42,,,,
14,to be able to get to a safe place right,6:44,G,2,,
14,now it is not gonna be safe for you to,6:48,,,,
14,be in Thailand or Vietnam or Bali when,6:51,,,,
14,you're not a citizen of that country and,6:54,,,,
14,you're trying to get medical care or,6:56,,,,
14,more importantly you're just trying to,6:59,,,,
14,be able to get access to food because,7:01,,,,
14,frankly you're at the very bottom of,7:04,,,,
14,that list you need to return to your,7:06,,,,
14,home countries and make sure that you,7:08,,,,
14,can prepare for this this is not,7:10,,,,
14,something that should be taken lightly,7:12,,,,
14,and if you believe that infection is,7:15,,,,
14,your worst case scenario you're,7:16,,,,
14,absolutely wrong it's collapse of all,7:19,,,,
14,infrastructure transportation,7:20,J,1,,
14,infrastructure medical facilities food,7:23,,,,
14,distribution is really what's a problem,7:25,,,,
14,and that's going to fail at scale if we,7:29,,,,
14,do not stem the tide of this right now,7:32,,,,
14,we are at a point in which we could stop,7:36,,,,
14,this but people that are continuously,7:39,,,,
14,traveling around and saying yeah this is,7:42,,,,
14,not that big of a problem I'll have the,7:44,,,,
14,flu and then I'll get over it,7:45,,,,
14,in a couple weeks those are the people,7:48,,,,
14,that quite frankly those are the people,7:51,A,2,,
14,that are the problem inside of this,7:54,,,,
14,system and I've seen that happening a,7:56,,,,
14,lot in side of the digital nomad,7:59,,,,
14,community again I consider myself a,8:02,,,,
14,digital nomad I've taken the,8:04,,,,
14,responsibility to get myself out of that,8:06,,,,
14,environment and make sure that I'm not,8:09,,,,
14,endangering myself primarily but more,8:11,,,,
14,importantly I'm not endangering people,8:14,,,,
14,around me and also endangering the,8:17,,,,
14,global population if we want this to be,8:20,,,,
14,something that is a small blip in human,8:23,,,,
14,history,8:24,,,,
14,we can do this right now by being able,8:27,,,,
14,to make sure that everyone voluntarily,8:30,,,,
14,self isolates doesn't fly it doesn't,8:33,,,,
14,interact with others or we can go the,8:36,,,,
14,other direction which is doing exactly,8:38,,,,
14,what you are doing right now which,8:41,,,,
14,frankly,8:42,,,,
14,is trashing the system so I hope that,8:46,,,,
14,was as clear as I could make it you need,8:49,,,,
14,to be able to stop this you can go back,8:52,,,,
14,and do this in the next three months,8:54,,,,
14,it's not that big of a deal but you need,8:56,,,,
14,to stop right now those are my thoughts,8:59,,,,
14,if you disagree with me please put them,9:03,,,,
14,down in the comments below I'm more than,9:04,,,,
14,happy to be able to fight you on this,9:06,,,,
14,one I think that we are at a precipice,9:08,,,,
14,in human history with regards to this,9:12,,,,
14,type of a virus and if it gets loose if,9:15,,,,
14,a billion people get this which the CDC,9:18,,,,
14,and the w-h-o are saying is a definitive,9:21,,,,
14,possibility we are going to have a,9:25,J,1,,
14,disaster that will make the Great,9:27,,,,
14,Depression look like a speed bump thanks,9:31,,,,
14,for listening to me if you're interested,9:32,,,,
14,in checking out anything else look at,9:36,,,,
14,these videos that are on the side of,9:37,,,,
14,this video bye,9:38,,,,
15,hey guys I'm John EFD and as a full time,0:03,L,1,A,2
15,traveler a lot of people been asking me,0:05,,,,
15,Johnny are you worried about the corona,0:08,,,,
15,virus and what are you gonna do so I'm,0:11,,,,
15,here in Southeast Asia and my next plan,0:16,,,,
15,is to fly to Eastern Europe in just a,0:19,,,,
15,few weeks and as they digital nomads who,0:21,P,1,,
15,just travels the world full time people,0:25,,,,
15,have been asking Johnny are you worried,0:26,,,,
15,are you concerned well here are my,0:28,,,,
15,thoughts I had a blog post about this,0:31,,,,
15,and a Facebook post I got a lot of,0:33,,,,
15,comments I figured let me go into a bit,0:35,,,,
15,more detail here on YouTube so let's,0:40,J,1,,
15,jump right in,0:41,,,,
15,alright question number one am I worried,0:54,,,,
15,am I scared,0:55,,,,
15,my panicked I think I'm gonna die the,0:58,,,,
15,answer is no I'm not worried because the,1:02,,,,
15,chances right now of dying from,1:05,,,,
15,coronavirus or way less that me getting,1:08,,,,
15,hit by a car while walking outside and,1:11,,,,
15,it doesn't matter where you live the,1:13,P,2,A,2
15,chances of you getting into car accident,1:15,,,,
15,or way way lower and die from that so if,1:18,,,,
15,you are so scared of the point zero zero,1:22,,,,
15,zero zero one chance of getting it and,1:24,,,,
15,dying just at home I from one I'm not,1:29,,,,
15,gonna let the panic worry me until,1:31,,,,
15,something actually happens and I'm,1:34,,,,
15,strong I'm healthy I got a lot of,1:36,,,,
15,vitamin D I'm an immune systems hi I'm,1:39,A,2,D,2
15,not over you know seven D and and weak,1:42,,,,
15,and sick already so the chances of,1:45,,,,
15,something actually happening for me to,1:47,,,,
15,die personally it's very very low and if,1:50,,,,
15,you're in the same situation don't worry,1:51,,,,
15,about it question number two don't take,1:55,,,,
15,precautions yeah of course,1:58,,,,
15,so as we mentioned you can do things,2:00,,,,
15,like make sure you get in vitamin A,2:02,,,,
15,vitamin D adequate vitamin D whether,2:04,,,,
15,it's from the Sun like I'm getting here,2:06,,,,
15,everyday in sri lanka or if you live,2:08,,,,
15,somewhere that's cold take vitamin d,2:10,D,1,,
15,liquid supplements keep your immune,2:12,,,,
15,system strong and healthy exercise eat,2:16,,,,
15,healthy have your stress low and wash,2:20,,,,
15,your freakin hands twenty seconds,2:23,,,,
15,soap and water don't touch your face,2:26,,,,
15,that's kind of the precautions that I've,2:28,,,,
15,made for myself and not just because a,2:30,,,,
15,coronavirus I always do that,2:33,D,2,C,2
15,I avoid crowded places or pure coughing,2:36,,,,
15,or who are sick if there are sick I just,2:38,,,,
15,leave all right and I don't just my face,2:41,,,,
15,it's something that I trained myself not,2:44,,,,
15,to do because that is how you get sick,2:45,,,,
15,it doesn't matter how many germs you,2:46,,,,
15,have in your hand I touched everything I,2:49,,,,
15,don't wear a mask and it's not necessary,2:54,,,,
15,if you're not touching your face if,2:57,,,,
15,you're not around people are sick if I,2:59,,,,
15,ever do get sick knock on wood then over,3:01,,,,
15,a mask,3:02,,,,
15,prevent others from getting sick but no,3:04,,,,
15,I'm not holding masks and you know,3:07,,,,
15,freaking out and not living life,3:09,,,,
15,question number three isn't gonna affect,3:12,,,,
15,my travel that's maybe I wish I could,3:15,,,,
15,say no it's not gonna affect my travel,3:17,,,,
15,because it doesn't affect me personally,3:19,,,,
15,I'm not afraid to go to places because,3:22,,,,
15,coronavirus but it may affect my travel,3:24,J,1,A,2
15,if places that want to go to end up,3:28,,,,
15,having quarantines flight cancellations,3:31,,,,
15,fright delays or just fear so if I go,3:35,,,,
15,somewhere where you a country where,3:37,,,,
15,everyone's very fearful and panicky I,3:38,,,,
15,don't want to be there and if I go,3:41,,,,
15,somewhere where people will become very,3:42,,,,
15,racist against Asians I don't want to be,3:45,,,,
15,there so it may mess up my travel plans,3:47,,,,
15,and it sucks because most of that would,3:51,S,1,C,2
15,be in people's minds and people are,3:53,,,,
15,creating their own fears but because of,3:56,,,,
15,that it becomes a real thing so that's,4:00,,,,
15,what sucks and the question would be,4:03,,,,
15,should you let it affect your travel,4:05,,,,
15,plan it's my advice as a full time,4:07,,,,
15,traveler someone who's been through all,4:08,,,,
15,this I would say if it becomes a real,4:12,,,,
15,genuine concern don't even fly home any,4:15,,,,
15,home country and that makes it worse,4:17,,,,
15,just stay where you are,4:19,,,,
15,but find a small not so populated town,4:22,,,,
15,hopefully by the sieve it's warm get,4:25,D,2,,
15,some fresh air stay away from big cities,4:27,,,,
15,stay away from airports don't change,4:29,,,,
15,your travel plans but if you're a ready,4:31,,,,
15,somewhere just enjoy where you are but,4:34,,,,
15,stay away from the crowds so I'm very,4:36,,,,
15,lucky that I'm in a small beach town in,4:38,,,,
15,Sri Lanka population is very small,4:41,,,,
15,literally there's nobody really on the,4:43,,,,
15,beach I spend most of my days on a,4:46,F,3,,
15,surfboard or here my home office and the,4:49,,,,
15,hotel I'm at the chest doesn't mean,4:51,,,,
15,getting something we're giving someone,4:52,,,,
15,something that's very very low if I was,4:54,,,,
15,in Italy for example to be honest I,4:57,,,,
15,would just stay in Italy I would,4:59,,,,
15,probably go see all the sights and be,5:02,,,,
15,you know one of the very few people and,5:04,,,,
15,these normally overcrowded tourist,5:06,,,,
15,destinations that's a plus but when I,5:09,,,,
15,fly to Italy just to take advantage of,5:11,,,,
15,the low prices of hotel,5:13,,,,
15,and you know to be able to see the you,5:16,,,,
15,know these touristy sites without much,5:18,,,,
15,people won't get a cool photo no freakin,5:20,,,,
15,way I think that would be very unsafe,5:24,,,,
15,for people to fly to Italy right now,5:27,A,3,,
15,just to you know take advantage of,5:32,,,,
15,flight deals or take advantage of the,5:33,,,,
15,low crowds but if I was already there I,5:36,,,,
15,would just stay there and that's what I,5:37,,,,
15,would recommend everyone and in general,5:40,,,,
15,I try to travel so anyways I'm what he,5:42,,,,
15,calls slow mad slow digital Nomad,5:44,,,,
15,travels I normally travel every two or,5:47,,,,
15,three months somewhere and I really aim,5:49,,,,
15,to slow that down even more to three to,5:51,,,,
15,six months that way I'm not on planes or,5:53,,,,
15,airports and that often and I can just,5:56,,,,
15,really enjoy one country or even one,5:58,,,,
15,city for two tutors you know six months,6:01,S,2,,
15,at a time and take advantage of that,6:03,,,,
15,question number four and this is a big,6:05,,,,
15,one who is a blame it's China to blame,6:09,,,,
15,yeah yeah they are to blame and this is,6:12,,,,
15,not politically correct so people are,6:14,,,,
15,gonna shun me or start commenting right,6:16,,,,
15,now but please stay and listen to number,6:18,,,,
15,five all right,6:19,,,,
15,so for number quote before is trying to,6:21,,,,
15,blame the answer is yes all right and,6:23,,,,
15,I've been to China maybe seven eight,6:26,,,,
15,years ago and not much has changed from,6:28,,,,
15,from everything I've heard a very,6:30,,,,
15,unsanitary their laws for health and,6:32,,,,
15,safety regulations are very very low and,6:34,,,,
15,you just can't trust anything you know,6:36,,,,
15,when I was there people were afraid to,6:38,,,,
15,eat food at restaurants or a street food,6:41,,,,
15,because people were using Street we not,6:46,,,,
15,even recycled but basically oil that had,6:49,,,,
15,been gone through the sewage system and,6:51,A,2,,
15,they would have scooped it back out,6:52,,,,
15,repack it you know filter a little bit,6:54,,,,
15,to clean it up to make it look clean and,6:56,,,,
15,then we sell it as cheap cooking oil and,6:59,,,,
15,you know then you know you have all,7:02,,,,
15,these things that come up all the time,7:03,,,,
15,with scandals of food safety in China,7:05,,,,
15,and the fact that their country and,7:08,,,,
15,their government doesn't do something,7:09,,,,
15,about it and it's not even just you know,7:12,,,,
15,not cracking down on it it's promoting a,7:15,,,,
15,culture and you know having a platform,7:19,,,,
15,where these things happen keep happening,7:22,,,,
15,all the time because all they promoted,7:24,C,3,,
15,for the last 30 years is,7:26,,,,
15,get rich no matter what it doesn't,7:28,,,,
15,matter if you hurt your fellow citizens,7:31,,,,
15,or you you know you fellow you know your,7:32,,,,
15,fellow countrymen as long as you're,7:35,,,,
15,getting ahead you making money that is,7:36,,,,
15,the most important thing and the fact,7:39,,,,
15,that you know they have that mentality,7:41,,,,
15,the lack of you know health and safety,7:44,,,,
15,and then promote continuing to promote a,7:47,,,,
15,culture where it's healthy or there's,7:50,,,,
15,health benefits of eating things like,7:52,,,,
15,shark fin soup or rhinoceros horn or,7:56,,,,
15,snakes or bats exotic animals and that,8:02,,,,
15,is so uncivilized and primitive and the,8:07,,,,
15,only reason why that continues today is,8:09,A,3,,
15,for two big reasons right because all of,8:12,,,,
15,our culture's no matter where you're,8:14,,,,
15,from Scandinavia you know from the US,8:16,,,,
15,from the Europe our ancestors all eat,8:19,,,,
15,crazy crap but we've stopped because,8:22,,,,
15,we're the times have moved on we become,8:25,,,,
15,cleaner and we realize hey there's no,8:27,,,,
15,magical you know health benefits of,8:30,,,,
15,rhino horn anymore all right and there's,8:33,,,,
15,laws so you just can't eat it it's not,8:35,,,,
15,just kind of something that just you,8:37,,,,
15,know goes around in the US or in Canada,8:39,,,,
15,or Western Europe anymore but in China,8:42,,,,
15,it still happens all the time people,8:44,,,,
15,really still believe in this and a big,8:46,,,,
15,part of it was after 1950 when the,8:49,,,,
15,current Communist Party came in they,8:52,,,,
15,basically killed all the educated people,8:55,,,,
15,it's gonna no more look up the Great,8:58,,,,
15,Leap Forward that killed millions of,9:01,,,,
15,people anyone that was educated and they,9:04,,,,
15,just created a culture of you know just,9:09,,,,
15,people that are in this little bubble,9:11,,,,
15,and the problem with that is now even,9:16,,,,
15,today in 2020,9:17,E,2,,
15,there's the Great Firewall of China so,9:20,,,,
15,people who are in China can't even get,9:24,,,,
15,information or be what I really interact,9:27,,,,
15,with the outside world to find out when,9:29,,,,
15,they're doing things that are either,9:30,,,,
15,wrong or they shouldn't be doing or to,9:33,,,,
15,really just move move ahead and you know,9:34,,,,
15,get out of their bubble so yes China but,9:38,,,,
15,mainly,9:39,,,,
15,the government and their standards are,9:41,,,,
15,to blame not to mention the government,9:44,,,,
15,completely dropped the ball when the,9:47,M,1,,
15,first case has come out came out and,9:49,,,,
15,they didn't take action if anything they,9:52,,,,
15,did the opposite they try to cover it up,9:53,,,,
15,like they do all the time,9:55,,,,
15,so yes China is to blame however point,9:59,,,,
15,number five and this is very very,10:00,,,,
15,important guys don't be racist to,10:03,,,,
15,Chinese people because it's not the,10:06,,,,
15,people,10:06,,,,
15,I mean 99.99% of the people that you're,10:09,,,,
15,gonna come across you know you're gonna,10:12,,,,
15,meet some Asian Canadian girl that grew,10:15,,,,
15,up in Toronto has never been to China,10:17,,,,
15,can be racist to her that's you being,10:19,,,,
15,ignorant then shouldn't do anything just,10:22,,,,
15,because one looks Asian like me or,10:24,,,,
15,someone who's Chinese or from you know,10:26,,,,
15,from wherever even if they're from China,10:28,,,,
15,like they personally probably do,10:30,,,,
15,anything they're probably you know,10:31,,,,
15,they're not the ones you know shopping,10:34,,,,
15,of these wet markets or eating exotic,10:36,,,,
15,meats and you know and spreading the,10:39,,,,
15,disease the paradigm is sick alright so,10:42,F,3,,
15,by you being racist to them or anyone,10:44,,,,
15,being racist to them that's being,10:45,,,,
15,ignorant is stupid and that's and it,10:50,,,,
15,makes it hard because it's hard for,10:52,,,,
15,people to conceptualize you know like on,10:56,,,,
15,one hand there's the super laughs PC in,11:00,,,,
15,a politically correct crowd that says,11:01,,,,
15,don't ever blame anyone at the same time,11:05,,,,
15,if you never blame anyone any never go,11:07,,,,
15,to the coral prom nothing ever gets,11:10,,,,
15,chanting fixed or nothing changes a lot,11:13,,,,
15,people don't realize but coronavirus is,11:15,,,,
15,a strain of SARS that came from people,11:18,,,,
15,eating bat meat at these same wet,11:22,,,,
15,markets and even if they didn't come,11:23,F,3,,
15,from the actual you know mule the fact,11:26,,,,
15,that they're doing their trading the,11:28,,,,
15,stuff and that contamination is going to,11:31,,,,
15,other meats or other you know weather,11:33,,,,
15,snake meat or even you know if that,11:35,,,,
15,contamination gets to fish or chicken or,11:37,,,,
15,your vegetables I mean and don't start,11:40,,,,
15,blaming meat eaters now I mean romaine,11:42,,,,
15,lettuce has had more outbreaks of,11:45,,,,
15,disease and then you know pretty much,11:48,,,,
15,any kind of meat out there so,11:50,O,2,A,1
15,it's the health and safety standards in,11:52,,,,
15,general as a whole right and if we don't,11:55,,,,
15,ever go to the core palm and we're just,11:58,,,,
15,like oh you know everyone's you know,11:59,,,,
15,don't blame anyone then nothing gets,12:01,,,,
15,fixed but very important number five is,12:04,,,,
15,don't just be racist to people for no,12:06,,,,
15,reason so shouldn't do anything,12:07,,,,
15,if you want to you know fight someone if,12:10,,,,
15,you want to change something you're,12:11,,,,
15,going to be angry be angry at the system,12:13,,,,
15,not the citizens be angry at the,12:17,,,,
15,government of China a mainland China not,12:20,,,,
15,the people that come from there you know,12:22,,,,
15,sure if you see one individual doing,12:24,E,1,,
15,something they shouldn't be doing coffee,12:26,,,,
15,on people you know you know touting,12:29,,,,
15,about how you know great you know that,12:31,,,,
15,they want to go buy some exotic meats or,12:33,,,,
15,something yeah stop them but not just a,12:37,,,,
15,random people so point number six what,12:40,P,1,,
15,are my travel plans now so my original,12:42,,,,
15,plan was to fly to Eastern Europe in,12:45,,,,
15,just a few weeks and I'll continue to do,12:47,,,,
15,that I've been in sri lanka for two,12:49,,,,
15,months now I really like it here and,12:51,,,,
15,it's time to move on I want to go to,12:53,,,,
15,Europe for the summer that was my plans,12:54,J,1,,
15,and I'm not gonna change it because of,12:56,,,,
15,some fears all right especially cuz it,12:58,,,,
15,doesn't really affect me or the place,12:59,,,,
15,I'm going to if I was I will check,13:05,,,,
15,resources to make sure that we're flying,13:07,,,,
15,does it have a big outbreak and it's,13:09,,,,
15,unsafe if it is then I'll just stay here,13:11,,,,
15,because as a digital nomad one of the,13:14,,,,
15,benefits is that could work for my,13:15,P,2,A,2
15,laptop I'm literally gonna work from,13:17,,,,
15,here after I make this video I can just,13:21,,,,
15,be anywhere in the world and that's,13:22,,,,
15,what's so nice about location dependence,13:24,,,,
15,remote work and being an entrepreneur is,13:27,,,,
15,being able to have that luxury of being,13:29,,,,
15,able to just stay somewhere and say you,13:30,,,,
15,know what I'm gonna stay here until this,13:32,,,,
15,whole thing blows over,13:33,A,2,D,2
15,but aside from that if nothing you know,13:37,,,,
15,is actually wrong there's not you know,13:39,,,,
15,there's just panic but there's no actual,13:41,,,,
15,reason not to go I'm not letting my,13:43,,,,
15,travel plans and I don't think anyone,13:45,,,,
15,should either if you want to go to,13:46,,,,
15,Europe for the summer just make your,13:48,,,,
15,plans if anything things gonna be,13:49,,,,
15,cheaper it's gonna be less crowded and,13:53,,,,
15,at the end of the day there's really,13:55,,,,
15,nothing you personally can do about us,13:57,,,,
15,if you're not gonna,13:59,,,,
15,go oh well but that's where we get to,14:03,D,1,,
15,point number seven have a plan B have an,14:05,,,,
15,escape plan,14:06,,,,
15,so my escape plan is if all kind of goes,14:10,,,,
15,to to hell it happens there's nothing I,14:14,,,,
15,can do to change it I'm not out there,14:15,,,,
15,creating cures you know I don't think,14:17,,,,
15,you guys are either so if you're not,14:19,,,,
15,actually doing something about it and,14:21,D,2,C,2
15,you're just panicking,14:22,,,,
15,we're just hoarding stuff or we're just,14:24,,,,
15,on the news click baking spreading fear,14:26,,,,
15,gonna help him the problem but have a,14:28,,,,
15,plan B because if things do go wrong we,14:30,,,,
15,want to have a back-up plan mine is just,14:32,,,,
15,to stay here this little surf town in,14:34,,,,
15,Sri Lanka very small population fresh,14:36,,,,
15,air sunshine fresh fruit and stay here,14:40,,,,
15,till blows over for you it might be go,14:43,,,,
15,go camping goat into the woods for and,14:46,,,,
15,go camping a little you know bring all,14:48,,,,
15,your stuff with you and just stuff,14:50,,,,
15,isolate for a while let's be great,14:51,,,,
15,together nature move to some small town,14:54,,,,
15,or a village or there's enough how many,14:56,,,,
15,people around you know have enough food,14:58,,,,
15,you know don't pour toilet paper funny,15:00,,,,
15,thing is I haven't you told a paper in,15:03,,,,
15,three months I'm in Asia they had these,15:05,,,,
15,bum guns these spray guns with water,15:06,J,1,A,2
15,they work so good like there's so many,15:09,,,,
15,things that we think that are such vital,15:11,,,,
15,necessities that we kind of without that,15:13,,,,
15,really aren't that big of a deal turn,15:15,,,,
15,off the TV turn off the news stop,15:19,,,,
15,sharing these things on social media,15:21,,,,
15,you're just freaking yourself out the,15:25,,,,
15,fear of things happening or way worse,15:29,,,,
15,that when it's actually happened and,15:31,,,,
15,either way there's nothing you can do,15:34,S,1,C,2

16,to summarize why I decided to come back,0:01,,,,

16,[Music],0:06,,,,
16,hey guys what's up i'm tori landry and,0:19,,,,
16,welcome back to my youtube channel so,0:21,,,,
16,earlier this week i decided to put an,0:23,,,,
16,end to my backpacking trip through,0:25,,,,
16,Central and South America and come right,0:27,P,1,,
16,back home to my home city Ottawa right,0:30,,,,
16,here in Canada but for the longest time,0:33,,,,
16,I wasn't planning on leaving so today,0:35,,,,
16,guys I want to share with you exactly,0:37,,,,
16,why I decided to leave a gorgeous,0:38,D,1,,
16,isolated beach where the temperatures,0:41,,,,
16,were above 28 degrees every day where,0:43,,,,
16,everyone was chill and having a great,0:46,,,,
16,time there was almost zero risk of,0:48,,,,
16,getting coronavirus to coming back to,0:50,,,,
16,the cold quarantine and quite frankly a,0:52,,,,
16,lot higher risk of getting and,0:55,,,,
16,transmitting coronavirus,0:57,,,,
16,everything started with people I mean my,1:03,F,3,,
16,parents started messaging me my friend,1:05,,,,
16,started messaging me tons of followers,1:07,,,,
16,started to message me and everywhere I,1:09,D,2,,
16,went the topic of coronavirus was,1:11,,,,
16,everywhere people were asking me you,1:14,,,,
16,know what are you gonna do are you gonna,1:16,,,,
16,go home are you gonna stay what happens,1:17,C,2,,
16,if X happens what happens if Z happens,1:19,,,,
16,the message started to infiltrate my,1:22,,,,
16,mind one day I was saying the other day,1:24,C,2,,
16,I was like maybe I should go and then,1:26,,,,
16,I'd get back to being like no that's,1:28,,,,
16,crazy,1:30,,,,
16,stay put I mean why would I go back to,1:31,,,,
16,Canada I one would have to take a plane,1:32,F,3,,
16,where there are tons of people who are,1:35,,,,
16,possibly infected with it once I get,1:37,,,,
16,back to Canada there's already so many,1:39,D,2,,
16,more cases here and that thought alone,1:41,,,,
16,is what really kept me for as long as it,1:43,,,,
16,did in Nicaragua and Central America to,1:45,F,3,C,3
16,be really honest,1:47,,,,
16,the second thing that really started to,1:52,,,,
16,affect me was social media and the news,1:54,,,,
16,now I gotta be super honest I am not the,1:57,,,,
16,type of person that enjoys watching the,1:59,,,,
16,news or goes out of my way to watch the,2:01,,,,
16,news I try to stay away from it as much,2:03,D,3,,
16,as possible but I could at this size I,2:05,,,,
16,mean it was taking over everything and,2:07,,,,
16,social media was just completely pug,2:10,,,,
16,barded I can't get away from this I,2:12,,,,
16,can't get away from it in person I can't,2:14,,,,
16,get away from it online and it really,2:16,,,,
16,started to make me think I mean maybe,2:18,,,,
16,you should be taking this seriously and,2:20,,,,
16,obviously now in hindsight yeah,2:21,,,,
16,completely but at the time when you're,2:24,,,,
16,in an isolated area where nobody around,2:26,,,,
16,you know locals not even the government,2:28,,,,
16,was really taking this seriously it,2:31,,,,
16,didn't really affect me until I started,2:32,,,,
16,to get this overwhelming response from,2:35,,,,
16,everybody else in the world Justin,2:36,,,,
16,Trudeau delivered this absolutely,2:39,,,,
16,insanely intense message to Canadians,2:40,,,,
16,and I think that's really when I started,2:44,,,,
16,to take this really really seriously let,2:45,,,,
16,me be clear if you're abroad it's time,2:48,,,,
16,for you to come home,2:51,,,,
16,sure I'm young healthy have a strong,2:56,,,,
16,immune system but if I do get sick,2:59,R,2,,
16,number one I'm alone,3:02,,,,
16,number two I'm in a country where I,3:03,,,,
16,don't know about the healthcare system,3:05,,,,
16,here and if any of you guys saw my solar,3:07,,,,
16,female traveling video then you'll know,3:09,,,,
16,that about two-and-a-half years ago I,3:11,,,,
16,got wildly sick in Indonesia to the,3:13,,,,
16,point that I had to be hospitalized and,3:16,,,,
16,it was expensive it was lonely it was,3:18,,,,
16,depressing,3:21,,,,
16,it was awful that started to get to me,3:22,D,3,,
16,quite a bit,3:25,,,,
16,not to mention Nicaragua a few days,3:26,,,,
16,before I left just had this massive,3:28,,,,
16,parade and rally in the streets of,3:30,,,,
16,Managua the capital celebrating the fact,3:32,,,,
16,that there was zero cases in Nicaragua,3:35,,,,
16,people were touching each other hugging,3:37,,,,
16,kissing people were selling food using,3:39,F,3,D,2
16,money I mean there was all the things,3:41,,,,
16,that we've been told to not do I mean if,3:43,,,,
16,they didn't have cases before they were,3:45,,,,
16,certainly about to have cases now,3:46,,,,
16,and then the fourth reason why I decided,3:53,,,,
16,to come home after all was when borders,3:55,,,,
16,started to shut down okay the last thing,3:58,,,,
16,I wanted to do was to get stuff sure,4:00,,,,
16,this might be paradise for a week or two,4:03,A,2,,
16,but if I get stuck here for weeks,4:05,,,,
16,or god forbid months that I would not be,4:07,,,,
16,in a good place my mindset started to,4:11,,,,
16,shift from being worried about getting,4:13,,,,
16,the virus to social order crime theft,4:15,D,2,,
16,supply chains and I had to ask myself is,4:19,,,,
16,this where I want to be for three months,4:21,,,,
16,when businesses shut down when people,4:25,,,,
16,are no longer making money and that,4:27,,,,
16,answer was no so yeah goodbye okay so I,4:29,,,,
16,officially just left the hostel,4:38,,,,
16,[Music],4:40,,,,
16,okay so I just got to New York yeah oh,5:00,,,,
16,my god so if you're feeling afraid right,5:04,,,,
16,now you got to know that it's totally,5:19,,,,

16,remember humans are adaptable and we're,5:22,,,,
16,going to adapt to whatever happens and,5:25,,,,
16,we just need to stay connected as a,5:27,,,,
16,country and as a group and and as humans,5:30,,,,
16,it's not even just the country at the,5:32,C,2,A,2
16,end of the day we can't really control,5:34,,,,
16,what happens to us right I mean we've,5:36,,,,
16,heard that over and over again but we,5:38,,,,
16,can control how we react to it and what,5:40,,,,
16,we do moving forward I personally I'm,5:42,,,,

18,judgment on this topic you might ask,0:28,,,,
18,well i'm not a lawyer i'm not a judge,0:31,,,,
18,but i have been,0:33,,,,
18,traveling the world for 20 years through,0:36,F,3,B,1
18,60 countries and for the past 15 years,0:40,,,,
18,i've been helping other people live and,0:42,,,,
18,work abroad,0:43,,,,
18,so i think that that makes me qualified,0:47,,,,
18,i'm probably more qualified than a real,0:49,,,,
18,judge on this topic,0:51,,,,
18,in this video i'm going to go through,0:53,,,,
18,all of the countries that are offering,0:56,,,,
18,some sort of remote work permit at this,0:58,,,,
18,time,0:59,,,,
18,and let you know whether they are,1:01,,,,
18,approved,1:02,,,,
18,or denied of course this is not actual,1:05,,,,
18,legal advice and you can make your own,1:06,,,,
18,decision,1:07,,,,
18,on where you'd like to work from your,1:09,,,,
18,laptop and travel but i hope that this,1:12,,,,
18,video helps you make that decision,1:14,E,1,A,2
18,[Music],1:19,,,,
18,so first of all let's just review really,1:21,,,,
18,quickly what a digital nomad,1:23,,,,
18,visa is because 2020,1:26,,,,
18,has been the year of the digital nomad,1:28,,,,
18,visa for sure,1:30,,,,
18,there are upwards of 15 or 20 different,1:32,,,,
18,digital nomad visas on the planet right,1:35,,,,
18,now,1:35,,,,
18,and before the coronavirus pandemic,1:37,,,,
18,there were zero,1:38,,,,
18,there were some freelancer visas some,1:41,,,,
18,startup visas,1:42,,,,
18,and work permits and things like that,1:44,,,,
18,but before,1:45,,,,
18,this pandemic there was no such thing as,1:47,J,2,B,1
18,a digital nomad visa so the basic,1:49,,,,
18,premise,1:50,,,,
18,of any digital nomad visa program is,1:53,,,,
18,that it allows,1:54,,,,
18,a foreigner to live in a country for an,1:57,,,,
18,extended period of time,1:59,,,,
18,cases,2:02,,,,
18,usually six to 12 months but in some,2:02,,,,
18,up to two years and this is a lot,2:05,,,,
18,different from,2:06,,,,
18,traveling around the world on your,2:08,,,,
18,passport because,2:10,,,,
18,you can stay a lot longer in countries,2:12,,,,
18,that you could stay,2:13,,,,
18,for for 30 to 90 days sometimes with,2:16,,,,
18,your passport you can now stay up to,2:18,,,,
18,six months one or two years so that is,2:21,,,,
18,the biggest,2:22,,,,
18,value of a digital nomad visa but as,2:25,,,,
18,you're about to find out,2:26,,,,
18,some of them are more valuable than,2:28,,,,
18,others,2:29,,,,
18,it's also important to point out before,2:31,,,,
18,we start,2:32,,,,
18,that a digital nomad visa or a remote,2:35,,,,
18,work visa,2:36,,,,
18,is not a permanent residency,2:39,,,,
18,and it's not a path to citizenship in a,2:42,,,,
18,different country,2:43,,,,
18,it's just a temporary permit to stay,2:46,,,,
18,officially working from your laptop,2:48,,,,
18,which you could arguably do,2:51,,,,
18,without that visa as millions of digital,2:53,,,,
18,nomads,2:54,,,,
18,have been doing for the past years and,2:56,,,,
18,even decades,2:58,,,,
18,so it's just legitimizing the digital,3:00,,,,
18,nomad lifestyle,3:02,,,,
18,in a way and giving remote workers a,3:05,,,,
18,more,3:05,E,1,A,1
18,official status to work from their,3:07,,,,
18,laptops in different countries,3:10,,,,
18,so let's start with barbados barbados,3:12,,,,
18,was the first,3:13,,,,
18,country to announce and launch a digital,3:16,,,,
18,nomad visa program,3:18,,,,
18,back in july of 2020 and i was so,3:20,,,,
18,excited,3:21,,,,
18,that i made a video about it but as soon,3:24,,,,
18,as more of the details came out about,3:26,,,,
18,this barbados,3:28,,,,
18,welcome stamp it turned out that it,3:30,,,,
18,could have been,3:31,,,,
18,a bit more hype than i originally,3:34,,,,
18,thought the welcome stamp allows,3:36,Q,1,A,2
18,foreigners to,3:37,,,,
18,live in barbados for up to a year and,3:40,,,,
18,work remotely from their laptops,3:42,,,,
18,but prior to the barbados visa,3:46,,,,
18,most citizens of most countries could,3:48,,,,
18,travel there anyway,3:50,,,,
18,for up to six months so this,3:53,,,,
18,digital nomad visa is doubling the,3:56,,,,
18,length of,3:56,,,,
18,time that you can stay in barbados but,3:59,,,,
18,it comes,4:00,,,,
18,with a price a two to three thousand,4:02,,,,
18,dollar,4:03,,,,
18,non-refundable application fee and so,4:06,,,,
18,that is,4:06,,,,
18,definitely a downside unless you have a,4:09,,,,
18,specific reason that you want to stay in,4:12,,,,
18,barbados for 12 months,4:14,,,,
18,i'm gonna say pass denied,4:20,,,,
18,i'm gonna hit that less hard,4:24,,,,
18,yeah i should have invested more in my,4:26,,,,
18,gavel,4:27,,,,
18,and if anyone from any country's,4:30,,,,
18,government is watching this video,4:32,,,,
18,i do recommend that before your country,4:34,,,,
18,launches a digital nomad visa or remote,4:37,,,,
18,work permit,4:37,,,,
18,you consult with one of the many digital,4:40,T,2,A,1
18,nomads out there,4:41,,,,
18,include,4:44,,,,
18,myself included who can tell you what to,4:44,,,,
18,as perks in your program to get people,4:47,,,,
18,to actually,4:48,,,,
18,apply for it so you got to make sure,4:50,,,,
18,that you're offering,4:51,,,,
18,value to remote workers more than just,4:54,,,,
18,an extended length of stay,4:56,,,,
18,to actually attract us to go to your,4:58,,,,
18,countries am i right let me know in the,5:00,,,,
18,comments below what you,5:01,,,,
18,would like to see in a digital nomad,5:04,,,,
18,visa and let's make it happen,5:06,,,,
18,next up we have estonia estonia,5:10,,,,
18,is a baltic country that shot to fame,5:13,,,,
18,internet fame that is back in 2014 with,5:16,G,2,,
18,the announcement of the first,5:18,,,,
18,ever e-residency program where you could,5:21,,,,
18,open,5:21,,,,
18,a company from outside the country and,5:24,,,,
18,run it online from anywhere in the world,5:26,,,,
18,but,5:27,,,,
18,shortly after barbados announced their,5:29,,,,
18,digital nomad visa,5:30,G,2,,
18,estonia followed up with one of their,5:32,,,,
18,own and it's,5:34,,,,
18,also allowing a one year stay in estonia,5:38,,,,
18,but there are some key differences,5:39,,,,
18,between barbados and estonia,5:42,,,,
18,estonia's digital nomad visa has a much,5:45,,,,
18,lower application fee of only 80 to 100,5:48,,,,
18,euros,5:49,,,,
18,compared to the 2 or three thousand,5:51,,,,
18,dollars that barbados is charging so,5:54,,,,
18,there's a lower barrier to entry for the,5:57,,,,
18,estonia visa,5:59,,,,
18,and it also provides more value because,6:02,,,,
18,estonia is located in northern europe,6:06,,,,
18,but as part of the schengen zone so,6:09,,,,
18,that means that you could actually,6:11,,,,
18,create a home base,6:12,,,,
18,in estonia and travel to nearby schengen,6:16,,,,
18,countries,6:17,,,,
18,without that taking away from your total,6:19,,,,
18,number of days,6:20,,,,
18,in the schengen so before the digital,6:23,,,,
18,nomad visa or without the digital nomad,6:26,,,,
18,visa,6:27,,,,
18,if you went to estonia you could travel,6:29,,,,
18,there for 90 days,6:30,A,2,,
18,including every other country in the,6:32,,,,
18,schengen but now you can go to,6:35,,,,
18,estonia for 90 days and then into the,6:37,,,,
18,schengen for 90 days,6:38,,,,
18,and hop back over the border to your new,6:42,,,,
18,home base the downside of the estonia,6:45,,,,
18,visa however,6:46,,,,
18,is that if you stay for 183 days,6:50,,,,
18,or more you will be considered a tax,6:53,,,,
18,resident in estonia,6:54,,,,
18,so i'm sure a lot of digital nomads are,6:57,,,,
18,going to try to,6:58,,,,
18,avoid doing that but overall estonia is,7:02,,,,
18,a much more,7:03,,,,
18,central and affordable home base for,7:05,,,,
18,remote workers compared to barbados,7:08,,,,
18,which is a bit,7:08,,,,
18,isolated with a high cost of living in,7:11,,,,
18,the caribbean,7:12,,,,
18,so in the case of estonia's digital,7:14,,,,
18,nomad visa,7:15,,,,
18,i say approved,7:18,,,,
18,the only catch with estonia's visa is,7:21,,,,
18,that you do,7:22,,,,
18,have to prove a minimum income of 3504,7:27,,,,
18,euro per month and you also have to,7:30,,,,
18,prove that you are,7:30,,,,
18,self-employed or that you work for a,7:33,,,,
18,foreign company,7:34,,,,
18,so for anyone making less than 3 500,7:37,,,,
18,euro per month,7:38,,,,
18,you're out of luck but you could still,7:40,,,,
18,visit estonia with your passport,7:43,,,,
18,our next country on the list is the,7:45,,,,
18,eastern european country of,7:47,J,1,,
18,georgia and when georgia's minister of,7:50,,,,
18,the economy,7:51,,,,
18,announced the remotely from georgia,7:53,,,,
18,program i was really excited to see what,7:56,,,,
18,they had,7:57,,,,
18,in store because georgia is a country,7:59,,,,
18,that has become,8:00,,,,
18,increasingly popular with digital nomads,8:03,,,,
18,expats and remote workers lately,8:06,,,,
18,it has a growing startup and co-working,8:09,,,,
18,scene,8:09,,,,
18,super fast internet and was also,8:12,,,,
18,supposed to be,8:13,,,,
18,the home of the nomad summit conference,8:16,,,,
18,in 2020,8:17,,,,
18,that unfortunately got pushed back a,8:19,,,,
18,little bit but the digital nomad visa,8:21,,,,
18,however,8:22,,,,
18,doesn't seem to offer that much value,8:25,,,,
18,it grants remote workers a period of 180,8:29,,,,
18,to 365 days to go and stay there and,8:32,,,,
18,this is including,8:33,,,,
18,from,8:36,J,2,,
18,if your country is currently restricted,8:36,,,,
18,travel to georgia during the coronavirus,8:39,,,,
18,but,8:40,,,,
18,that's about it to apply they say that,8:43,,,,
18,you should have a minimum,8:45,,,,
18,monthly income of two thousand dollars,8:47,,,,
18,per month but there's nothing that says,8:49,,,,
18,that you have to prove that you make,8:51,,,,
18,that much,8:52,,,,
18,although they also want you to have an,8:54,,,,
18,insurance policy,8:55,,,,
18,for coverage while you're there but,8:58,,,,
18,without the georgia digital nomad visa,9:01,,,,
18,you could already travel there depending,9:04,,,,
18,on your passport,9:06,,,,
18,for up to one year at a time without any,9:08,,,,
18,sort of official visa or,9:10,,,,
18,work permit so although the remotely,9:14,E,2,,
18,from georgia program,9:15,,,,
18,can make you official there were already,9:18,,,,
18,digital nomads,9:19,,,,
18,working in georgia for up to a year with,9:22,,,,
18,their passports,9:23,,,,
18,before this program was formed,9:26,,,,
18,so should you apply for it,9:30,,,,
18,i don't know it can't really hurt i mean,9:32,,,,
18,you really have nothing to lose there's,9:33,,,,
18,no application fee,9:35,F,3,,
18,there's very minimum requirements and,9:38,,,,
18,you'll get to join the remotely from,9:40,,,,
18,georgia club so yeah sure,9:43,,,,
18,apply up next we're hopping back,9:46,,,,
18,over to the caribbean to look at antigua,9:49,,,,
18,and barbuda's,9:51,,,,
18,remote work program this one has a,9:54,E,2,,
18,similar,9:54,,,,
18,application fee to neighboring barbados,9:57,,,,
18,however,9:58,,,,
18,antigua and barbuda are offering up to,10:01,,,,
18,two years of staying in the country,10:04,,,,
18,working from your laptop so that's one,10:06,,,,
18,of the longest,10:07,,,,
18,programs out there the nomad,10:10,,,,
18,digital residence visa program costs,10:13,,,,
18,fifteen hundred dollars to apply for an,10:16,,,,
18,individual,10:17,,,,
18,two thousand for couples or three,10:19,F,3,,
18,thousand dollars for families,10:21,,,,
18,i think they should switch that around,10:22,,,,
18,it should be digital nomad residents,10:25,,,,
18,whatever citizens from any country can,10:28,,,,
18,apply,10:29,,,,
18,and without the visa you can typically,10:31,,,,
18,stay for up to 180 days,10:34,,,,
18,on average so this visa,10:37,,,,
18,in residence program is basically,10:40,,,,
18,tripling the amount of time that you can,10:42,,,,
18,stay there,10:43,,,,
18,should you apply if you are looking for,10:46,,,,
18,a home base in the caribbean,10:48,,,,
18,yes approved if you are a,10:52,,,,
18,family a digital nomad family that's,10:54,,,,
18,looking for a home base,10:55,,,,
18,yes if you are a single person who's,10:59,,,,
18,just looking,11:00,E,1,A,2
18,to apply for a digital nomad visa,11:02,,,,
18,program,11:03,,,,
18,no why pay fifteen hundred dollars to go,11:07,,,,
18,to a country that you can already go to,11:09,,,,
18,for six months so i would only apply for,11:12,,,,
18,this one,11:12,,,,
18,if you are planning on making the,11:14,,,,
18,caribbean your home base for at least,11:17,,,,
18,two years and if you really love it,11:19,,,,
18,there then that will give you some time,11:21,,,,
18,to explore other permanent residency,11:23,,,,
18,or citizenship by investment options in,11:26,,,,
18,the region,11:27,,,,
18,although those typically cost from six,11:30,,,,
18,to seven figures and that's a topic for,11:32,,,,
18,another video,11:33,J,2,B,1
18,another country in the caribbean with,11:35,,,,
18,the digital nomad visa program,11:37,,,,
18,is bermuda and this one's offering stays,11:41,,,,
18,of up to,11:42,,,,
18,applying,11:45,,,,
18,one year with a very low threshold for,11:45,,,,
18,and a low application fee of only 263,11:49,,,,
18,dollars,11:50,,,,
18,to apply for the work from bermuda,11:52,,,,
18,program you will need to show,11:55,,,,
18,some source of income or at least say,11:57,,,,
18,that you have,11:58,,,,
18,a reliable source of income you'll also,12:01,,,,
18,need,12:01,,,,
18,travel insurance no criminal record and,12:04,,,,
18,be at least,12:05,,,,
18,18 years old as with any other digital,12:08,,,,
18,nomad visa program you'll also have to,12:10,,,,
18,show that you are either self-employed,12:12,,,,
18,or work for a foreign company but if you,12:15,,,,
18,do get approved to bermuda's program,12:18,,,,
18,you can get the application processed,12:20,,,,
18,really quickly,12:21,,,,
18,and move into your new island home in,12:23,,,,
18,just a matter of a week or so,12:25,,,,
18,so if you want to go see some pink or,12:28,,,,
18,white sand beaches and clear,12:30,,,,
18,blue water then i say apply,12:34,,,,
18,now let's move back from the caribbean,12:37,,,,
18,sea to,12:38,,,,
18,the adriatic with croatia's digital,12:41,,,,
18,nomad visa program,12:42,,,,
18,this one i'm actually really excited,12:45,,,,
18,about because,12:46,,,,
18,typically although croatia is not a,12:49,,,,
18,schengen country,12:50,,,,
18,it is in the eu and the longest that you,12:53,,,,
18,can stay,12:54,,,,
18,on just a passport with a tourist visa,12:56,,,,
18,is usually,12:57,E,1,A,1
18,90 days but with the new croatia visa,13:00,,,,
18,program,13:01,,,,
18,word is that you may be able to stay in,13:03,,,,
18,croatia with extensions for,13:06,,,,
18,up to two years and that is a really,13:08,,,,
18,great,13:09,,,,
18,home base for digital nomads because it,13:11,,,,
18,has a really,13:12,,,,
18,moderate affordable cost of living,13:15,,,,
18,around two to three thousand dollars per,13:17,,,,
18,month to live,13:18,,,,
18,very comfortably it has a mild climate,13:21,,,,
18,great food lots of outdoor activities,13:24,,,,
18,and things to do,13:25,,,,
18,and really fast internet you can also,13:28,Q,1,A,2
18,travel by,13:28,,,,
18,car or by bus or by plane to a lot of,13:31,,,,
18,neighboring countries in the region and,13:34,,,,
18,it's great if you like water sports,13:36,,,,
18,sailing and boating as well and although,13:38,,,,
18,the application fee,13:39,,,,
18,hasn't been announced yet i think it's,13:42,,,,
18,going to be on the low side,13:44,,,,
18,as,13:47,,,,
18,with quite a low barrier of entry as far,13:47,,,,
18,minimum income requirements for your,13:49,,,,
18,monthly income,13:51,,,,
18,and it could even include some other,13:53,,,,
18,perks like,13:54,,,,
18,free health care and connection to the,13:57,,,,
18,croatia local digital nomad community,14:00,,,,
18,so in the case of croatia's visa i will,14:03,,,,
18,say,14:04,,,,
18,apply now let's talk about the nearby,14:08,,,,
18,united arab emirates program which is a,14:12,,,,
18,remote work dubai visa and,14:15,,,,
18,this visa is also quite interesting,14:17,,,,
18,because it's giving you,14:19,,,,
18,an up to one year stay in the uae,14:23,,,,
18,and it is also a moderate application,14:26,,,,
18,fee of just a couple hundred dollars,14:29,,,,
18,however you do need to prove not only,14:31,,,,
18,that you are self-employed or,14:33,T,2,A,1
18,working for a foreign company but that,14:36,,,,
18,you have a minimum monthly income,14:37,,,,
18,of five thousand dollars per month so,14:40,,,,
18,not everybody will,14:41,,,,
18,qualify for that but without this visa,14:45,,,,
18,the maximum amount of time that you,14:47,,,,
18,could typically stay,14:48,,,,
18,is with a 30-day visa on arrival,14:51,,,,
18,so having the option to live in,14:54,,,,
18,dubai or the uae for up to a year is,14:58,,,,
18,quite valuable and the uae is also,15:01,,,,
18,a tax-free country with no income tax so,15:04,,,,
18,that's also a plus,15:06,,,,
18,dubai is also known for having a really,15:09,,,,
18,high quality of life although it does,15:11,,,,
18,have a rather,15:12,,,,
18,high cost of living and it looks like,15:14,G,2,,
18,real,15:17,,,,
18,the authorities in dubai are making a,15:17,,,,
18,effort to help remote workers,15:20,,,,
18,get acclimated to the local culture,15:23,,,,
18,there meet,15:24,,,,
18,other expats of which there are many,15:26,,,,
18,living in the emirates,15:28,,,,
18,and also get access to some public,15:30,G,2,,
18,services and even,15:32,,,,
18,schooling you'll also need proof of,15:34,,,,
18,international,15:35,,,,
18,travel and medical insurance which you,15:37,,,,
18,should have anyway,15:39,,,,
18,and you can check out the two companies,15:40,,,,
18,i use in this video's description,15:43,,,,
18,but for only a 287 dollar application,15:46,,,,
18,fee and the opportunity to live in dubai,15:49,,,,
18,for up to a year,15:50,,,,
18,i say apply,15:53,,,,
18,next we're going to change climates a,15:55,,,,
18,little bit and head over,15:57,,,,
18,to iceland which announced in october of,16:00,,,,
18,2020 that they too,16:02,,,,
18,were jumping on the digital nomad,16:04,,,,
18,bandwagon by,16:05,,,,
18,offering a remote work long stay visa,16:08,,,,
18,for iceland and this one has the,16:12,,,,
18,highest minimum income requirement that,16:14,,,,
18,i have seen,16:15,,,,
18,couple or,16:18,,,,
18,yet depending on if you are a single,16:18,,,,
18,family you must earn between 1 million,16:22,,,,
18,or 1.3 million icelandic krona per month,16:25,,,,
18,of 10,16:29,A,2,,
18,which is equivalent to 7 500 to upwards,16:29,,,,
18,000 us dollars per month and this is,16:32,,,,
18,because the cost of living,16:34,,,,
18,is quite high in iceland it could be,16:37,,,,
18,30 to 50 percent higher than living in,16:40,,,,
18,the us depending on,16:42,,,,
18,which city you're in although locals,16:44,,,,
18,live cheaper but with the exchange rate,16:46,,,,
18,and the cost of goods and services,16:48,,,,
18,it's a lot more expensive for foreigners,16:51,,,,
18,so there are five total requirements for,16:54,,,,
18,iceland's visa,16:56,,,,
18,first of course you'll have to be,16:57,,,,
18,self-employed or have a remote job,17:00,,,,
18,second you'll have to be a high earner,17:02,,,,
18,third you will have to,17:04,E,2,,
18,have a travel and medical insurance,17:06,,,,
18,policy that covers you in iceland,17:08,,,,
18,for up to fifteen thousand dollars which,17:11,,,,
18,you can get through,17:12,,,,
18,safety wing or world nomads up to 100,17:15,,,,
18,250 000 in coverage so no problem there,17:19,,,,
18,you'll also need to pay the 11 000 krona,17:22,,,,
18,application fee,17:23,,,,
18,about 83 us dollars and then you'll have,17:27,,,,
18,to get,17:27,,,,
18,all of your documentation verified,17:31,,,,
18,certified notarized and oppo styled so,17:34,F,3,,
18,that is a bit of a process on its own,17:37,,,,
18,but it's definitely possible,17:39,,,,
18,and once you get your application in,17:42,,,,
18,you'll wait about three or four weeks,17:44,,,,
18,for approval and then,17:46,,,,
18,you can travel to iceland three months,17:48,,,,
18,after that,17:49,,,,
18,which will kick off a 180th day stay,17:53,,,,
18,of being able to live and work with a,17:56,,,,
18,view of,17:57,,,,
18,fjords and glaciers so i guess you can't,17:59,,,,
18,really put a price on that,18:01,,,,
18,i've been to iceland five times and if,18:03,,,,
18,you want to check out more videos about,18:05,,,,
18,how to travel there,18:06,,,,
18,or what it's like to live and work there,18:09,,,,
18,uh check out,18:10,,,,
18,this playlist and links in the video's,18:12,E,1,A,2
18,description,18:13,,,,
18,but overall i would say unless you've,18:16,,,,
18,never been to iceland before,18:18,,,,
18,you don't have any specific reason to go,18:20,,,,
18,there i'm gonna take a pass,18:23,,,,
18,i would recommend applying for iceland's,18:27,,,,
18,visa,18:28,,,,
18,if you meet the income requirements and,18:30,,,,
18,you're looking for a nice,18:32,,,,
18,quiet place to get a lot of work done so,18:35,,,,
18,if you're looking for a big digital,18:37,,,,
18,nomad community,18:38,,,,
18,and warm weather and lots of social,18:41,,,,
18,activities,18:42,,,,
18,book,18:46,,,,
18,that's a no but if you need to write a,18:46,J,2,B,1
18,write a thesis start an online business,18:49,,,,
18,or go somewhere with peace and quiet,18:52,,,,
18,and you have the extra cash yes,18:55,,,,
18,and the next island nation we're going,18:58,,,,
18,to,18:58,,,,
18,is the cayman islands where without,19:02,,,,
18,their digital nomad visa program the,19:04,,,,
18,maximum amount of time you can stay,19:06,,,,
18,there,19:07,,,,
18,new,19:10,,,,
18,was previously six months but with its,19:10,,,,
18,cayman global remote work concierge,19:13,,,,
18,program,19:14,,,,
18,you can stay for up to two years but,19:18,,,,
18,hundred dollar,19:21,,,,
18,it will cost you not just a fifteen,19:21,,,,
18,application fee but actually the cayman,19:24,,,,
18,islands has even,19:26,,,,
18,higher income requirements compared to,19:28,,,,
18,estonia,19:29,,,,
18,if you're an individual you will need to,19:30,,,,
18,prove a minimum of one hundred thousand,19:33,,,,
18,dollars per year in,19:34,,,,
18,income couples will need to show 150 000,19:38,,,,
18,a year and families 180 000,19:42,,,,
18,per year you'll also need a notarized,19:44,,,,
18,bank reference that no other country,19:47,,,,
18,is requiring a criminal background check,19:50,,,,
18,identity,19:53,,,,
18,proof of health insurance and proof of,19:53,,,,
18,and employment or self-employment,19:57,,,,
18,but the cayman islands does offer a,20:00,,,,
18,really nice lifestyle that has attracted,20:03,,,,
18,some of the wealthiest people in the,20:04,,,,
18,world for a very long time,20:06,,,,
18,i haven't been but i have friends who,20:08,,,,
18,simply love it there,20:10,,,,
18,so for the opportunity to live there for,20:13,,,,
18,two years,20:14,,,,
18,in a tax-free jurisdiction if you're,20:16,E,1,A,1
18,looking for a place to,20:18,,,,
18,update your address and change your tax,20:20,,,,
18,domicile,20:22,,,,
18,this cayman concierge program,20:25,,,,
18,is pretty interesting so i would say if,20:28,,,,
18,you have the income,20:29,,,,
18,to qualify and you are looking to live,20:33,,,,
18,a caribbean island lifestyle then,20:35,,,,
18,definitely apply,20:37,,,,
18,for everyone else pass but you can still,20:40,,,,
18,go visit for six months,20:43,,,,
18,skip another zero tax jurisdiction with,20:47,,,,
18,a digital nomad,20:48,,,,
18,visa is anguilla anguilla is a beautiful,20:52,,,,
18,tiny little british colony in the,20:54,Q,1,A,2
18,caribbean with only about 15 000,20:56,,,,
18,people on it but it looks just like a,20:59,,,,
18,postcard and now you can live and work,21:01,,,,
18,there for up to a year,21:03,,,,
18,for a 2 000 application fee,21:07,,,,
18,so it's not ideal if you really want to,21:11,,,,
18,go there for a year and not just a few,21:13,,,,
18,months,21:14,,,,
18,you could apply but otherwise if you,21:16,,,,
18,just want to go on holiday to anguilla,21:18,,,,
18,with your laptop,21:20,,,,
18,go for it in this case unless you want,21:22,,,,
18,to stay,21:23,,,,
18,long-term or you're looking for a income,21:26,,,,
18,tax-free,21:27,,,,
18,new destination to call home pass,21:31,,,,
18,go go check it out but no need to apply,21:34,,,,
18,for the visa,21:35,,,,
18,and finally over in the indian ocean,21:38,,,,
18,just off the coast of madagascar near,21:41,,,,
18,reunion island,21:43,,,,
18,is mauritius offering a one-year,21:46,,,,
18,digital nomad visa program so this would,21:49,,,,
18,be the first,21:50,,,,
18,digital nomad visa program of its kind,21:52,,,,
18,over,21:53,,,,
18,in africa without a digital nomad visa,21:56,,,,
18,you could only travel to mauritius for,21:58,T,2,A,1
18,60 days so if you're looking for,22:01,,,,
18,a very exotic very remote very beautiful,22:04,,,,
18,very isolated place to live and you're,22:07,,,,
18,into,22:08,,,,
18,scuba diving or snorkeling or just,22:10,,,,
18,hanging out on the beach,22:12,,,,
18,then i would say to give it a go but,22:15,,,,
18,otherwise,22:16,,,,
18,day,22:19,,,,
18,just go for a month or so and call it a,22:19,,,,
18,mauritius,22:23,,,,
18,if you want to stay long-term it's a,22:25,,,,
18,good place to quarantine or social,22:27,,,,
18,distance but it's not the best,22:29,,,,
18,place to integrate with a community of,22:32,,,,
18,remote workers and it's not the best,22:34,,,,
18,place to get cheap flights to other,22:36,G,2,,
18,digital nomad destinations so,22:39,,,,
18,you be the judge yes both of us can be,22:43,,,,
18,judges,22:44,,,,
18,is that correct yes so let me know in,22:46,,,,
18,the comments below,22:49,,,,
18,which digital nomad visa will you be,22:51,,,,
18,applying for,22:52,,,,
18,if any give this video a thumbs up,22:55,G,2,,
18,or else and subscribe for more weekly,22:59,,,,
18,travel updates and videos to help you,23:01,,,,
18,work online,23:02,,,,
19,hey friend welcome back to Chase for,0:01,A,2,,
19,adventure my name is Annette and my,0:02,,,,
19,husband and I have been traveling the,0:04,,,,
19,world specifically in Asia for almost,0:06,,,,
19,the last two years we've decided to make,0:09,,,,
19,this video and I'm sorry that it's not,0:10,,,,
19,done chronologically with the rest of,0:11,B,1,,
19,our videos but with the entire,0:13,,,,
19,coronavirus outbreak I know that there,0:15,,,,
19,has been lots of questions especially,0:17,,,,
19,since we've been based out of Asia for,0:18,,,,
19,so long and also because of the,0:21,,,,
19,inconsistency of posting videos and just,0:23,,,,
19,everything that's been going on there,0:24,,,,
19,has been quite a few life changes that I,0:26,,,,
19,think you guys should be aware of I,0:27,,,,
19,think the only way to tell this story is,0:29,A,2,,
19,to go back to the beginning back in,0:30,,,,
19,January when we were actually traveling,0:32,,,,
19,through China we were in Shanghai for a,0:34,,,,
19,few weeks because we were expecting some,0:36,,,,
19,friends that were travelling that were,0:38,,,,
19,getting there on January 16th and,0:39,,,,
19,honestly we spent two of the best weeks,0:41,,,,
19,of our lives while we were there we were,0:43,,,,
19,adventuring through China having a great,0:45,,,,
19,time and we made a friend that was from,0:47,,,,
19,Shanghai and she was lovely and she did,0:49,,,,
19,warn us around the second week that we,0:51,,,,
19,were in China that there had been,0:52,,,,
19,apparently some virus outbreak back then,0:55,,,,
19,it wasn't a big deal yet everybody was,0:57,F,3,D,2
19,just like hey wear a mask wash your,0:59,,,,
19,hands and this was in Shanghai I want to,1:01,,,,
19,say this was around January the 18th so,1:03,,,,
19,January the 19th came the 20th and the,1:06,,,,
19,21st and things started escalating a,1:09,,,,
19,little bit in a city called Wuhan at the,1:11,,,,
19,time we didn't really know where Wuhan,1:12,,,,
19,was we were in Shanghai so we weren't,1:14,,,,
19,really worried about it because again it,1:16,,,,
19,wasn't a big deal back then and so we,1:18,,,,
19,were like okay well where he wanted to,1:21,,,,
19,stay for Chinese New Year which was on,1:22,,,,
19,January 25th but we couldn't afford,1:24,D,1,C,2
19,staying because everything gets super,1:26,,,,
19,expensive in China during that time so,1:28,,,,
19,Daniel and I decided to just change,1:29,,,,
19,plans last-minute and head to South,1:30,,,,
19,Korea so January 22nd comes along but,1:33,,,,
19,time we board the plane on the way to,1:35,,,,
19,South Korea we see that everybody is,1:37,,,,
19,freaking out people are starting to wear,1:38,,,,
19,masks everybody's reading the same exact,1:41,J,1,F,2
19,news article online and so Daniel and I,1:42,,,,
19,looked at each other and we're like what,1:44,,,,
19,is going on so we pulled up the last,1:47,,,,
19,second of internet that we had there are,1:49,,,,
19,about a hundred people infected with,1:50,,,,
19,something that was called the novel,1:52,,,,
19,coronavirus at the time and again we,1:55,,,,
19,just didn't know how to react we had,1:56,,,,
19,never dealt with like an epidemic this,1:58,,,,
19,way and had no idea what to expect once,2:00,,,,
19,we made it to Korea there were a couple,2:02,,,,
19,of cases that had made it to Seoul but,2:04,,,,
19,since we were only in Seoul for five,2:05,,,,
19,days we weren't worried about it we were,2:07,,,,
19,getting text messages on her phone of,2:09,,,,
19,hey guys wear masks we're hand sanitizer,2:11,,,,
19,nothing,2:11,,,,
19,closed everything was fine shortly after,2:14,,,,
19,leaving South Korea to film a,2:16,,,,
19,documentary in coal MOC in Thailand that,2:18,B,1,A,2
19,you guys will be learning about soon we,2:21,,,,
19,learned that there was also an outbreak,2:23,,,,
19,that happened in South Korea and that,2:24,,,,
19,places like Thailand and the Philippines,2:26,,,,
19,wearing allowing people who had been to,2:28,,,,
19,China in the last two weeks which if the,2:31,,,,
19,let the cutoff was 14 days we had made,2:33,,,,
19,it to Thailand 16 days after we had left,2:36,,,,
19,China so we've made it to Thailand,2:38,,,,
19,everything's fine we got an apartment,2:40,,,,
19,for a month and kind of vocation in,2:41,,,,
19,Thailand,2:42,,,,
19,everything's great peachy people are,2:43,S,1,C,2
19,wearing masks but still not a big deal,2:45,,,,
19,and we decided on February 24th to head,2:47,,,,
19,over to the Philippines because we,2:49,,,,
19,really loved all of the videos that we,2:50,,,,
19,made in the Philippines last time in,2:51,,,,
19,Cebu and you seemed to enjoy it a lot as,2:54,,,,
19,well and so we went back we were there,2:56,,,,
19,for two weeks and today is March 14th we,2:59,,,,
19,left the Philippines on March 9th and we,3:02,,,,
19,learned today that now tomorrow on March,3:05,,,,
19,15th they're gonna be closing the,3:07,,,,
19,domestic and international borders in,3:09,D,2,,
19,the Philippines we actually had some,3:11,,,,
19,friends that were due to come to,3:12,,,,
19,Thailand and unfortunately are now stuck,3:15,,,,
19,there until the 15th of April as we see,3:18,,,,
19,what happens with this whole coronavirus,3:19,,,,
19,thing so it's crazy to me that this went,3:23,,,,
19,from something that at least to us was,3:25,,,,
19,you know no big deal oh you know there's,3:27,,,,
19,a flu virus going around wash your hands,3:28,F,3,,
19,it's fine too you know we're getting,3:30,,,,
19,calls from our family members hey are,3:32,,,,
19,you guys okay I hear you guys are in,3:33,,,,
19,Asia is everything fine borders are,3:36,,,,
19,closing there's no toilet paper back,3:38,,,,
19,home the way that it's all just kind of,3:40,,,,
19,unfolded and escalated from when we were,3:43,,,,
19,in China and they announced the outbreak,3:45,,,,
19,to now where we can't even go back home,3:48,,,,
19,it's just mental it's such a surreal,3:51,,,,
19,sort of experience so with the,3:54,,,,
19,coronavirus a lot of things have changed,3:56,,,,
19,in our lives for one we've had a lot of,3:59,,,,
19,things that we've had to cancel for,4:00,,,,
19,example we had our chase your adventure,4:02,A,3,,
19,tours that we're supposed to be going,4:04,,,,
19,through Thailand literally right now but,4:07,,,,
19,because of the corona virus and,4:08,,,,
19,everything going on back home those had,4:10,,,,
19,to be canceled also we had planned for,4:14,,,,
19,March 26 to be back with our families,4:16,,,,
19,for a few months because we haven't seen,4:17,,,,
19,them in over a year and to give you a,4:19,,,,
19,some background we had done a really,4:22,,,,
19,epic surprise for Daniel's pair,4:24,,,,
19,we had gotten like a hotel stay,4:25,,,,
19,coordinated a dog-sitter we were gonna,4:27,,,,
19,stay in like this really pretty resort,4:29,,,,
19,for a couple days just to spend family,4:31,S,2,,
19,time and then immediately getting a car,4:33,,,,
19,on my way to Miami because we were going,4:35,,,,
19,to be the servers at a restaurant to,4:37,,,,
19,surprise my parents when whenever they,4:39,,,,
19,were eating dinner and we ended up,4:42,,,,
19,having to tell our families that,4:43,,,,
19,unfortunately you know all the red,4:44,,,,
19,lights have been cancelled it's really,4:46,,,,
19,difficult to get in and out of America,4:48,,,,
19,right now and we didn't want to risk,4:50,,,,
19,getting stuck in quarantine for two,4:51,,,,
19,weeks without able to work and without,4:53,,,,
19,being able to leave the US which is,4:55,,,,
19,obviously for our line of work quite a,4:56,,,,
19,bit of a concern we also learned that,4:58,,,,
19,our insurance doesn't cover pandemics,5:00,,,,
19,and so when it came to all of the,5:02,,,,
19,cancellations we were kind of stuck in,5:03,,,,
19,the mud we lost quite a bit of money,5:05,,,,
19,Justin canceled affairs like hotels and,5:08,,,,
19,bus tickets that we had already,5:09,A,2,,
19,purchased and most importantly are,5:11,,,,
19,"$1,300 flights that still haven't been",5:13,,,,
19,refunded to us which as you can imagine,5:14,,,,
19,is a lot of money to not be in your bank,5:17,,,,
19,account when it should be so we weren't,5:19,,,,
19,even able to afford new flights to go,5:21,,,,
19,back home and things ended up getting,5:24,,,,
19,more complicated but we'll get there in,5:26,,,,
19,a second another way that the,5:27,,,,
19,coronavirus has really impacted us is,5:29,,,,
19,our finances as you can imagine the,5:31,,,,
19,tourism industry has really taken quite,5:34,,,,
19,a big hit as people who make almost 50%,5:36,,,,
19,of their income on tours having those,5:39,C,3,,
19,being gone now has made quite a,5:42,,,,
19,difference also something that we didn't,5:44,,,,
19,expect was even here on YouTube you,5:46,,,,
19,watching this video thank you because a,5:48,,,,
19,lot of people have actually stopped,5:50,,,,
19,watching travel videos because they're,5:52,,,,
19,so afraid of travel and so our ad,5:55,,,,
19,revenue on YouTube has gone down by,5:57,,,,
19,almost 75 percent and now I'm not saying,5:59,,,,
19,this because I'm complaining at the end,6:01,,,,
19,of the day you know we started off this,6:02,,,,
19,lifestyle not depending on things like,6:05,,,,
19,YouTube or affiliate income or our,6:07,,,,
19,tourists to make it happen and we did,6:08,,,,
19,start off from a place of remote work,6:10,,,,
19,and freelance and so for us it's fine we,6:12,A,3,,
19,are transitioning into that and I'll,6:14,,,,
19,tell you a little bit more about that in,6:15,,,,
19,a second but it is you know hard and,6:18,,,,
19,disheartening when you've built a,6:19,,,,
19,business for the last two years and,6:21,,,,
19,you're thrilled about it you feel like,6:22,,,,
19,it's finally picking up and then,6:24,,,,
19,something like this goes like and,6:26,,,,
19,totally takes your life for a loop now I,6:29,,,,
19,will say with that side is like worse,6:32,,,,
19,things can happen you know we're really,6:33,,,,
19,grateful that we have our health and,6:35,,,,
19,you know there really isn't anything,6:37,,,,
19,going on here in Thailand at the moment,6:39,,,,
19,though obviously our hearts are with all,6:41,,,,
19,of those people out there who have,6:42,,,,
19,gotten the corona virus or have lost a,6:44,E,2,,
19,family member due to coronavirus my,6:46,,,,
19,heart also goes out to those people who,6:48,,,,
19,are immunocompromised and are at a,6:50,,,,
19,special disability when it comes to,6:52,,,,
19,these viruses and susceptibility and,6:53,,,,
19,mortality so on that note I want to give,6:56,,,,
19,a big hug to everybody out there who has,6:58,,,,
19,been affected with the corona virus even,6:59,,,,
19,if it's just as simple as you lost your,7:02,,,,
19,job because you got laid off because,7:03,,,,
19,business is down right now or if it's,7:05,,,,
19,because you're out of work for two weeks,7:06,,,,
19,because everything back home is closed I,7:08,,,,
19,know it's a hard time guys but we're,7:10,,,,
19,gonna make it through but I know you,7:12,,,,
19,also have a lot of questions regarding,7:14,,,,
19,what now we've gotten questions like are,7:17,,,,
19,you quitting YouTube where are you now,7:19,,,,
19,how long are you traveling for are you,7:21,,,,
19,traveling so I want to give you some,7:23,B,2,,
19,answers to that to answer your first,7:25,,,,
19,question are we quitting YouTube the,7:27,,,,
19,answer is absolutely not as you guys,7:29,,,,
19,have probably noticed through our India,7:31,,,,
19,vlogs that are the ones that are,7:32,,,,
19,currently publishing and all the other,7:33,,,,
19,ones there's no word about coronavirus,7:35,,,,
19,because all of our videos are backlogged,7:37,,,,
19,so you will still have consistent,7:39,,,,
19,content probably for the next few months,7:41,,,,
19,and then hopefully the coronavirus will,7:43,,,,
19,slow down and we'll be able to go back,7:45,,,,
19,to traveling like we normally do if you,7:47,,,,
19,are ever curious as to what it is that,7:49,,,,
19,we do on a day to day basis we do have,7:51,F,3,,
19,an Instagram account where we update our,7:53,,,,

20,may have noticed mm-hmm,0:10,,,,
20,we are at my stepdads house right,0:12,B,2,,
20,outside of Asheville North Carolina and,0:15,,,,
20,this is where we landed when we decided,0:18,,,,
20,to return home from Columbia which is,0:20,,,,
20,what we're gonna talk about today yeah,0:21,,,,
20,so you may have seen our quarantine life,0:23,,,,
20,video there for meta-gene we were pretty,0:26,,,,
20,much stuck in our apartment there for a,0:28,F,3,,
20,couple weeks and the lockdown kept,0:30,,,,
20,getting extended commercial flights were,0:33,,,,
20,totally grounded the borders were closed,0:35,,,,
20,so we were not sure if and wasn't gonna,0:37,,,,
20,be able to leave metazine,0:39,,,,
20,and we also kept getting emails from the,0:41,,,,
20,US embassy in Bogota telling us about,0:44,,,,
20,the restrictions and about the,0:46,,,,
20,humanitarian flights that Spirit,0:48,,,,
20,Airlines was sending and they always,0:50,I,2,,
20,ended every email by saying we can I,0:52,,,,
20,guarantee flights for Americans if you,0:55,,,,
20,don't take this flight home prepare to,0:57,,,,
20,remain abroad indefinitely indefinitely,1:04,,,,
20,which definitely don't get me wrong we,1:06,,,,
20,really like meta-gene it's a city we've,1:08,,,,
20,already been to a few times but we,1:10,,,,
20,didn't really feel comfortable being,1:11,B,2,A,2
20,there indefinitely that's kind of scary,1:14,,,,
20,yeah if you think about it and we're,1:16,,,,
20,very fortunate like Rachel said her,1:17,,,,
20,stepdad has a house out here in the,1:19,,,,
20,mountains if we had to go back and stay,1:21,,,,
20,with family and risk you know bringing,1:23,,,,
20,the coronavirus with us we probably,1:25,,,,
20,would have stayed put but we were able,1:28,,,,
20,to come back here we flew to Fort,1:30,,,,
20,Lauderdale we're gonna show you some,1:32,,,,
20,clips actually of our trip leaving meshy,1:34,,,,
