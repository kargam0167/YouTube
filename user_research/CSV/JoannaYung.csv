9;Ivy Xu;Transitioning from fast travel to slow travel is definitely one of the first things we learn as digital nomads. It\'s so easy to burn out and get tired! I also love slow traveling because that\'s how we learn more about the places we go from a modern perspective, it\'s people, and the future that the place is trending towards. I enjoy learning about that so much more than the typical tourist sites or even ancient history in museums.

42;ATST;18 months ago, I graduated from University. I wanted to be a digital nomad however I couldn\'t risk it and I found comfort in working for companies abroad for 2-3 months and move to another country. Once the pandemic started, I became jobless and I had two choices, either continue the journey in South East Asia as a full time digital nomad or come back to my home country Morocco. I decided to be a full time digital nomad in KL - Malaysia. Times were hard, especially during the 3 months of total lockdown. However, this was the best decision I took. The freedom I feel everyday is worth it. This year was the best year of my life. A year full of downs but most importantly full of lessons.

I decided to be a full time digital nomad in KL - Malaysia. Times were hard, especially during the 3 months of total lockdown. However, this was the best decision I took. The freedom I feel everyday is worth it. This year was the best year of my life. A year full of downs but most importantly full of lessons. Enjoy the digital nomadic lifestyle.;http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyi6QvO2cm3OIbIKPUzquBw;0

68;Bob Hoskins;"9 minutes wasted and she\'s said basically nothing anybody but a young child would know. Your views are pitiful and you\'re trying to teach this lifestyle? I don\'t understand. Don\'t you have to be good at something to teach it? The view count could be related to the emptiness of your words. Its like you\'ve floated around the world and absorbed so little. Or you\'re keeping what you\'ve learned a secret. You might want to limit the use of the phrase Digital Nomad as it basically refers to broke ass losers trying to be hip and cool and popular and failing miserably (99.9% of them). They leave thinking ""it will be OK"" instead of establishing online income adequate for their living expenses BEFORE they go. Of course that takes a while to get going for most of us and most young people have zero patience. Hence the problem. You seem to have a good eye for vistas. You might want to focus more on showing people those than you talking. So many YouTubers think we\'re interested in seeing them blab on and on. We\'re not. We want to see interesting videos (this is a video website after all) and if you want to narrate those videos that\'s just fine but the main thing people come to YouTube for is the video, not someone talking about something they seem to barely know. Maybe I\'m being harsh but when you said you\'ve formed an Academy, that really took the cake. First people coach 1 on 1, then they teach groups, then they have seminars, then they set up an Academy which is another term for School of Learning. Are you going to set up a university next week?
