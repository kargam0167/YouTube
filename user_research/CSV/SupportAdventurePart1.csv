11;Sam\'s Soapbox;"I think you are massively inflating the maximum potential size of the independent digital sector and at the same time being extremely naive about the site-specific aspects of the world economy. Sectors such as oil and gas, logistics (which is the backbone of e-commerce), manufacturing, construction etc etc are all completely location dependent. And that\'s without mentioning the worlds largest industry; food. Every aspect, from food production and agriculture through to restaurants and delivery services, are not just location dependent but location limited. By this I mean growing different crops is limited to certain climates, soils, humidities etc etc and cooking certain foods is limited to specific audiences in specific locations (Try serving duck-faces in a restaurant in London v a restaurant in Chiang-Mai and you\'ll see what I mean, these things are location specific). I would say maybe 1% (probably an over estimation) of the worlds economic activity is generated via completely location independent means so the digital sector is probably already at saturation point. I also think that lockdown has shocked a lot of people in the community into realising the fragility of a lifestyle without a base. When lockdown hit, a lot of travellers/digital nomads found themselves stranded and needing to be repatriated back to their parents/siblings houses. They have essentually become dependents due to living a lifestyle that purports to be the most independent. I would not be surprised if the DN community shrank considerably because of this pandemic.";Ugz5iy2CWyZiji3MliN4AaABAg;;2;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVjahErL7j8&lc=Ugz5iy2CWyZiji3MliN4AaABAg;2020-06-12 21:35:29;1;"I think you are massively inflating the maximum potential size of the independent digital sector and at the same time being extremely naive about the site-specific aspects of the world economy.
