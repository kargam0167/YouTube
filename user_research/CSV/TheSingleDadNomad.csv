2;natural healing for all;I honestly feel you should stop your nomad lifestyle for now, if you\'re traveling on public transport, there are numerous ways you can covid.

3;The Single Dad Nomad;@natural healing for all sounds like you\'ve put some good thought into it. I imagine the world will open back up by then, since the economies can\'t handle it, and people will ultimately have to make their own choices when or if to travel and how to do so comfortably and safely. I sure hope a vaccine is developed ASAP, I know I don\'t want to stay in Michigan during the winter.;UgzkW8CASYthy6CIvMB4AaABAg.9A1d9uZlKWr9A2rG13LnoX;natural healing for all;0;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g43A1DAvo_g&lc=UgzkW8CASYthy6CIvMB4AaABAg.9A1d9uZlKWr9A2rG13LnoX;2020-06-18 12:44:25;0;@natural healing for all sounds like you\'ve put some good thought into it.

4;natural healing for all;I\'ve also lived in places with contagious diseases without travel insurance even without vaccinations. I was younger and healthier when I did that, I wouldn\'t do that now. These are unique times, this disease unlike any other has closed the world down. Part of the reason why in my opinion it\'s not a good idea to travel, if I get stuck the British Embassy is not going to help me. 1) Because they are rubbish 2) Because the foreign office is advising against all essential travel. I\'m not counting on a vaccine BUT the best scientific minds are working on it worldwide, all governments are backing them, so there is every chance they can succeed. RV or a motorcycle is a very good idea, I\'m willing to wait until next year, but that time more places should open up. If a vaccine isn\'t available, I will go ahead and live my nomad life with caution. I\'ll travel with in the country and other places in Europe. RV or a motorcycle is not a possibility so I\'ll cycle and take public transport sometimes wearing a mask and do a lot of camping.;UgzkW8CASYthy6CIvMB4AaABAg.9A1d9uZlKWr9A2olnzVurk;natural healing for all;0;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g43A1DAvo_g&lc=UgzkW8CASYthy6CIvMB4AaABAg.9A1d9uZlKWr9A2olnzVurk;2020-06-18 12:22:41;0;I\'ve also lived in places with contagious diseases without travel insurance even without vaccinations.

5;The Single Dad Nomad;I\'ve made a video or two updating where I\'m at now and what I\'m up to. I flew in April and it was okay. But that was to find refuge in the forests of USA haha. People can make up their minds if they want to travel or not. I\'ve lived in places where you could catch dengue, encephalitis, zika, yellow fever, swine flu, typhoid, and more. I recommend vaccinantions, but they don\'t exist for every disease that\'s out there. But also, I wouldn\'t count on a vaccine. Even if one is developed by next year, you still won\'t know if it\'s safe and effective for another 3-5 years. And that\'s IF they even develop one. Personally, I\'m considering building out an RV or modifying a motorcycle so I can travel North and Central America without getting on a plane. If a vaccine isn\'t developed, how long will you wait, do you think, before traveling again? I feel like it\'s based on the rate of spread, number of people infected, and how the medical system in the area is handling it.;UgzkW8CASYthy6CIvMB4AaABAg.9A1d9uZlKWr9A2BTUAqB6J;natural healing for all;1;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g43A1DAvo_g&lc=UgzkW8CASYthy6CIvMB4AaABAg.9A1d9uZlKWr9A2BTUAqB6J;2020-06-18 06:30:31;0;I\'ve made a video or two updating where I\'m at now and what I\'m up to.
