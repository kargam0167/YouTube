4;Traveler;Great to see you got the hell out of CM to a lower population place. Beware of ATMs not working at your location. Have enough cash should you need it. Thailand ATMS went out for a while so I advised all my people to get cash or but money in the local bank so you have some access. Good luck in this troubled times. Your business should pick up if you are doing sells on line because no body wants to go out.;UgwJBM-i0Nqc1rJ6PPl4AaABAg;;0;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnZN49e_6Vw&lc=UgwJBM-i0Nqc1rJ6PPl4AaABAg;2020-03-25 21:43:44;1;Great to see you got the hell out of CM to a lower population place.

5;Johnny FD;Thanks for the tip. I actually took out cash last week before things got crazy as Sri Lanka is a mostly cash country. On Friday when lockdown happened the ATM imposed a max $20 limit, luckily I had taken out $500 and always keep $300usd on me just in case.;UgwJBM-i0Nqc1rJ6PPl4AaABAg.96dxPjW2I9f96gvc3_946o;Traveler;0;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnZN49e_6Vw&lc=UgwJBM-i0Nqc1rJ6PPl4AaABAg.96dxPjW2I9f96gvc3_946o;2020-03-27 01:25:48;0;Thanks for the tip.

11;peter gaffney;I called my son in Ohio and told him to go get a whole bunch of food and supplies why? not because of the virus but because of the fear of the virus that will cause people to empty the shelves of the store. One thing you want to keep in mind as you\'re traveling is that you can get access to primary 1st world polminary medical care. The twofold danger is having a secondary illness in old age or not having good medical care.;Ugw8VGG4VYo93NwOY9d4AaABAg;;1;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnZN49e_6Vw&lc=Ugw8VGG4VYo93NwOY9d4AaABAg;2020-03-05 13:52:38;1;I called my son in Ohio and told him to go get a whole bunch of food and supplies why? not because of the virus but because of the fear of the virus that will cause people to empty the shelves of the store.

12;Johnny FD;The problem with people being afraid of empty shelves, causes everyone to start hoarding full and supplies all at once, which then becomes the actual cause of empty shelves. Look at the toilet paper situation for an example. Personally I think that everyone with a house or long term rental should always have 2 weeks of food and water and supplies at hand always regardless of what has happened. Neil Strauss\' Emergency was a great book for that inspired me to start doing that years ago. As for Medical care, I trust the pulmonary medical care much more in Thailand than I would in the US, especially with the US being overworked and understaffed. For places like Thailand, Sri Lanka, Ukraine, etc, the good news for us, is that they have private hospitals as an option that won\'t get over crowded as they are too expensive for most locals to go to. It\'ll be more difficult to get medical care in the US, Canada, and the UK if things really did get bad.;Ugw8VGG4VYo93NwOY9d4AaABAg.95piT9fZRVc95qVf8F6uuc;peter gaffney;1;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnZN49e_6Vw&lc=Ugw8VGG4VYo93NwOY9d4AaABAg.95piT9fZRVc95qVf8F6uuc;2020-03-05 21:11:18;0;The problem with people being afraid of empty shelves, causes everyone to start hoarding full and supplies all at once, which then becomes the actual cause of empty shelves.

13;peter gaffney;In some ways racism can not be avoided. I just left Vietnam where some Japanese are returning to Japan because taxis will not stop for them because they think that maybe they are Chinese. It is just an accident of circumstances that requires generalization. You cannot interview each individual. I decided to skip Cambodia and Thailand and go directly to Tbilisi Georgia not because of the virus directly but because airlines were beginning to shut down access out of Thailand because when a disease hits Thailand it spreads everywhere because of the sex trade and sense we do not know the extent of which this disease will affect transportation and health options I did not want to get stuck in Thailand.;UgzlceBQYb-K-ohSEe54AaABAg;;0;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnZN49e_6Vw&lc=UgzlceBQYb-K-ohSEe54AaABAg;2020-03-05 13:38:15;0;In some ways racism can not be avoided.
