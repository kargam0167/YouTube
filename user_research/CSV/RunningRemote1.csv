2;Roz Christopherson;It\'s not just the commuting time that is regained as a result of remote work. It is the mental energy that goes into commuting. It takes mental energy to drive to work, take public transportation to work, etc. That mental energy is freed up when working from home. That mental drain of commuting is avoided. Employers are the ones to gain as well as the employee when workers have more mental energy available. Also, the vaccines for COVID are not promising more than 3-6 months of immunity due to the mutative nature of COVID. Doctors/scientists are hoping for 1-2 years of immunity. That is a hope, not a promise. The world is still experimenting when it comes to COVID. So COVID is going to be around for a while even with the vaccines. They are not eliminating it as in the case of polio to a large degree. They are only going to be able to control the swiftness of the spread.;UgzW-QeqcKqz5b1cWyV4AaABAg;;0;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4gB-M-aQqg&lc=UgzW-QeqcKqz5b1cWyV4AaABAg;2020-11-29 00:28:15;0;It\'s not just the commuting time that is regained as a result of remote work.

4;Running Remote;Honestly, I completely agree with you. I think your personal network may become less and less important and your competency will become a more important asset.;UgwqZYWLR_F_3nrT5TV4AaABAg.9Dg5EzSPHvo9Dg7OoD8j_s;José Aparecido Conceição;2;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4gB-M-aQqg&lc=UgwqZYWLR_F_3nrT5TV4AaABAg.9Dg5EzSPHvo9Dg7OoD8j_s;2020-09-16 17:37:58;0;Honestly, I completely agree with you.
